Why are there so many infected in front of the Ochi family's gate?[pcms]

Searching along the Ochi family's fence for a back door, we found a[r]
small gate not too far from the main road in front of the main gate.[pcms]

*3395|
[fc]
Looking back, the infected were swarming towards us. It seems they[r]
followed us here.[pcms]

Onee-san, while carrying Ms. Ochi on her back, pulls out a gun from[r]
her waist and fires at the lock of the back door.[pcms]

*3399|
[fc]
The lock seems to be completely broken. But whether it will open is[r]
another matter.[pcms]

*3400|
[fc]
When Onee-san tries to open the door, it doesn't budge as if something[r]
is stuck.[pcms]

With a kick from her thick-soled boots, the door opens as if it had[r]
fainted.[pcms]

*3403|
[fc]
We managed to evacuate everyone to the other side of the fence while[r]
watching the infected chasing us from behind.[pcms]

I quickly close the door and use Frank-senpai's bat as a bar to keep[r]
it shut.[pcms]

But the door itself doesn't seem very sturdy, creaking every time the[r]

It was as unreliable as a tin roof on a typhoon day.[pcms]

No one can be seen at the mansion's entrance that leads inside. Are[r]
they barricaded inside?[pcms]

*3414|
[fc]
And what happened to all those SPs in black suits that were here[r]
before?[pcms]

*3415|
[fc]
Did they evacuate with Ms. Misao? No, she said she would contact us if[r]
we waited.[pcms]

*3416|
[fc]
Ms. Misao must be inside this mansion.[pcms]

At that moment, about ten gunshots rang out all at once, and I[r]
hurriedly crouched down to the ground.[pcms]

It seems I was grazed on the arm, blood is flowing down, but it's not[r]
a serious injury.[pcms]

I turned around to go back to where we all were before..., and after[r]
that, I couldn't make a sound.[pcms]

Onee-san has been shot in the leg and has fallen. The bleeding is[r]
severe.[pcms]

*3424|

Next to me, Souichirou has collapsed face down. Blood is flowing from[r]
his head, forming a pool of blood.[pcms]

*3425|

Arai's chest has several holes in it. He's dead with his eyes wide[r]
open.[pcms]

[fc]
Akari-san, who had been thrown aside, slowly got up and stared at[r]
Arai's dead face.[pcms]

*3427|
[fc]
And then, she quietly shed tears.[pcms]

As I slowly turned around to the rough footsteps, men in black suits[r]
appeared from behind cover.[pcms]
