Four years ago, twin sisters Satsuki-san and Senior Ayame were caught[r]

In my arms, Senpai Ayame broke down crying. Like comforting a child, I[r]
gently stroked her back.[pcms]

They say there are at least three people in the world who look alike."[pcms]

way...? That Satsuki-san hates you."[pcms]

"It must be because of the red eyes, surely. I thought so too. Until[r]
