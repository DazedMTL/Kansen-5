"That's too bad. We couldn't come to an agreement."[pcms]

*3135|

Kazuo and the men in black suits were facing each other across the[r]
desk. At Kazuo's feet, a pool of blood had already formed.[pcms]

[ns]Black Suit B[nse]
"If you're willing to double the offer, we might consider it."[pcms]

*3137|
[fc]
[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"That's quite an unreasonable demand."[pcms]

*3138|
[fc]
Kazuo smiled sweetly. However, when he spoke next, the smile vanished,[r]
replaced by a contemptuous glare.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz16"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"Now that Oz is dead, you've lost your leader. Without Oz, you're[r]
nothing but a bunch of small fry. I can't pay the kind of money you're[r]
talking about to the likes of you."[pcms]

*3140|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit C[nse]
"You bastard! Getting cocky just because you're quiet."[pcms]

*3141|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit B[nse]
"Calm down. This guy's gonna die soon anyway. Let's just laugh off his[r]
last bit of bravado."[pcms]

[ns]Black Suit C[nse]
"That's true...hahaha."[pcms]

"..."[pcms]

*3144|
[fc]
Kazuo's hand moved quickly, tapping keys on the terminal at his[r]
fingertips.[pcms]

*3145|
[fc]
The men reacted to his movements, firing their guns all at once.[pcms]

Kazuo's body jerked as it took the bullets. When the gunfire stopped,[r]
he was slumped over the desk, dead.[pcms]

*3147|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit B[nse]
"Damn it, what did that bastard do?"[pcms]

*3148|
[fc]
The man went around to the back of the desk to look at the terminal.[r]
However, no one could tell what Kazuo had done.[pcms]

*3149|

[ns]Black Suit C[nse]
"There's no doubt he did something. Let's get out of here before[r]
anything happens."[pcms]

*3150|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit D[nse]
"Yeah, that's the safest bet. You can't do anything if you're dead."[pcms]

*3151|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit B[nse]
"Hey, wait. Before that, shouldn't we get what Oz wanted? If we screw[r]
this up, we get no reward."[pcms]

*3152|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit D[nse]
"But..."[pcms]

*3153|
[fc]
Soon after, noise began to come from the corridor beyond the door.[pcms]

*3154|

[ns]Black Suit E[nse]
"Hey, it's getting noisy in the hallway."[pcms]

*3155|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit D[nse]
"What? Could it be..."[pcms]

*3156|
[fc]
In a panic, one of the men in black suits opened the door. Beyond it,[r]
led by a blonde girl, countless infected were squirming and screaming[r]
as they headed towards the men.[pcms]

*3157|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit D[nse]
"The rooftop... That bastard unlocked the VIP room entrance on the[r]
rooftop!"[pcms]

*3158|
[fc]
[ns]Black Suit B[nse]
"What?! Then..."[pcms]

The girl peeked through the door that had been left ajar, with[r]
numerous infected lined up behind her.[pcms]
