I wonder what I'm even doing here on this beach.[pcms]

*5045|
[fc]
I was forcibly brought here to clear my head, but sulking in a place[r]
like this just makes me feel even more depressed.[pcms]

*5046|
[fc]
The strong sunlight is burning my listless body. I can tell that the[r]
other guests are looking at me strangely as I just sit here.[pcms]

"Arai-kun, get the ball!"[pcms]

*5048|
[fc]
A beach ball rolls in front of me. But I just stare at it, unable to[r]
react.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ha1_sw1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ha01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=330 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Arai[nse]
"No..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5051|
[fc]
Seeing that I'm not picking up the ball, Hanazawa walks over to me.[pcms]

*5052|
[fc]
Has there ever been a time in her life when she wanted to be left[r]
alone?[pcms]

*5053|
[fc]
It seems like she can't tell that I'm not in the mood to play on the[r]
beach.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ha2_sw1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ha02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_han s="hana0019"]
[ns]Hanazawa[nse]
"Let's play together, come on, please?"[pcms]

*5055|
[fc]
Hanazawa forcefully grabs my hand trying to get me to stand up. When I[r]
shake her off with all my might, she looks sad.[pcms]

*5056|
[fc]
[ns]Arai[nse]
"Everyone's waiting, hurry up and go."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ha2_sw1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ha07"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Hanazawa[nse]
"Okay..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5058|
[fc]
Hanazawa grabs the ball and, with a face that still seems to have[r]
something to say, goes back to the others.[pcms]

*5059|
[fc]
[ns]Arai[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*5060|
[fc]
I should have just stayed quietly in the hotel rather than showing[r]
such an embarrassing display.[pcms]

*5061|
[fc]
The injury itself isn't a big deal, but it's been a day of losing[r]
various things, including trust from others and my own overblown self-[r]
perception.[pcms]

*5062|
[fc]
After making a fool of myself in front of professional scouts and[r]
getting injured, there's no chance for redemption during this training[r]
camp.[pcms]

*5063|
[fc]
Not belonging to a professional junior team or even a school team,[r]
it's frustrating to end up with such results on one of the few chances[r]
I had to appeal...[pcms]

*5064|
[fc]
I can't even face Akari-chan.[pcms]

*5065|
[fc]
I've liked her since we attended the same kindergarten, but before I[r]
could confess, she became friends with otaku guys like Izubuchi and[r]
Nakazawa.[pcms]

*5066|
[fc]
Even though I've never been that close to her, it's always those[r]
guys...[pcms]

*5067|
[fc]
But I'm too embarrassed to approach her in the same way.[pcms]

*5068|
[fc]
I've started hearing that my father's company is on the brink of[r]
collapse.[pcms]

*5069|
[fc]
It's probably only a matter of time before it goes under.[pcms]

*5070|
[fc]
If that happens, it won't just be soccer I'll have to give up; I might[r]
not even be able to attend school anymore.[pcms]

*5071|
[fc]
There will be a gap between me and Akari-chan from a good family.[r]
We'll become residents of different worlds...[pcms]

*5072|
[fc]
I know it myself, but I'm not smart. Of course, my grades are the[r]
same.[pcms]

*5073|
[fc]
It's impossible for me to get a scholarship and advance, and I have no[r]
idea what kind of job I could do.[pcms]

*5074|
[fc]
If I could make it into a top professional team, that would be great,[r]
but I've nipped that possibility in the bud myself.[pcms]

*5075|
[fc]
I understand it's a tough world, but with enough effort, even an[r]
annual income of billions is within reach.[pcms]

*5076|
[fc]
If that were the case, I could have helped my parents...[pcms]

*5077|
[fc]
But in yesterday's practice match against a strong school team, I[r]
painfully realized my own lack of ability.[pcms]

*5078|
[fc]
It wasn't everyone else holding us back. It was my own lack of skill.[pcms]

*5079|
[fc]
[ns]Arai[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*5080|
[fc]
I wish the whole world would turn upside down. If only there was a[r]
reset button to start everything over...[pcms]

*5083|
[fc]
Looking over, it seemed like Hanazawa was being entangled by a man I[r]
didn't recognize.[pcms]

*5084|
[fc]
He clung to the reluctant Hanazawa, forcefully held down her head, and[r]
stole her lips against her will.[pcms]

"Mmm! N-nooo! Mmph..."[pcms]

The commotion caught the attention of the people around, causing a[r]
stir.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5089|
[fc]
Yet... no one tried to step in to help. Not even the guys from the[r]
soccer team or the cheer squad.[pcms]

*5090|
[fc]
There must be someone who owes Hanazawa a favor. Isn't there a single[r]
person with a sense of justice among these beachgoers?[pcms]

*5091|
[fc]
...It's infuriating. I feel like smashing everything to pieces.[pcms]

*5092|
[fc]
I rushed over to Hanazawa's side, grabbed the man's shoulder to turn[r]
him around, and punched him hard.[pcms]

"Ah..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

I've done it... a violent incident at the training camp...[pcms]

I grabbed Hanazawa's hand and started running wildly, pushing through[r]
the beachgoers, heading somewhere far away. That was all I could think[r]
about...[pcms]

*5104|
[fc]
Looking back, the man I had punched was bleeding and was already[r]
approaching another woman.[pcms]

*5105|
[fc]
He seemed less like a drunkard and more like a drug-addled lunatic.[pcms]

*5106|
[fc]
How did someone like that blend in at the beach? Because of him, I...[pcms]

*5107|
[fc]
As if trying to shake off the disgusting feeling of my future being[r]
tied to that strange man, I kept running.[pcms]

*5108|
[fc]
Aimlessly, without thought...[pcms]
