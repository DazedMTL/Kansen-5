After taking a shower, I left the room to get a drink, being careful[r]
not to wake the person sleeping in the bed.[pcms]

*2089|
[fc]
I wonder why Souichirou hasn't come back yet. Could it be that he[r]
heard us from outside and was considerate enough not to disturb us? I[r]
hope that's not the case, it would be embarrassing.[pcms]

*2090|
[fc]
Somehow, that thought makes me feel shy. I hope there's a different[r]
reason.[pcms]

In the middle of the hallway, on a sofa, one of Katsuo-san's[r]
subordinates in black was fast asleep.[pcms]

*2093|
[fc]
He seemed to be having a nightmare, letting out terrible groans. I[r]
thought about waking him up, but it felt wrong to disturb his sleep,[r]
and I didn't even know who he was.[pcms]

*2094|
[fc]
I left him be and continued on towards the VIP room at the end of the[r]
hallway.[pcms]

As expected, Katsuo-san's private bar was spread out before me.[pcms]

*2097|
[fc]
I didn't come for alcohol; I was looking for a soft drink, but I[r]
couldn't help but feel tempted.[pcms]

*2098|
[fc]
Of course, there wouldn't be any Mountain Dew in Katsuo-san's private[r]
bar, so I settled for a regular soda.[pcms]

The black-suited man who had been sleeping earlier seemed to be waking[r]
up and was looking around dazedly.[pcms]

*2102|
[fc]
Maybe he had a bad wake-up? He seemed to be having a bad dream.[pcms]

Before I had time to think, I was thrown to the floor with incredible[r]
force, unable to even breathe, looking up at the man from the ground.[pcms]

I managed to stop the man who was trying to bite my neck as he loomed[r]

When the man gave up on biting my neck, he grabbed my arm instead.[pcms]

I thrashed wildly trying to shake off his arm, but his strength was so[r]
immense that my desperation meant nothing to him.[pcms]

*2118|
[fc]
With my arm's base and wrist caught, I desperately pushed against the[r]
man's jaw, fighting against his hunger.[pcms]

*2119|
[fc]
But... such resistance wasn't enough against someone so unforgiving.[pcms]

*2120|
[fc]
The physical strength he had before infection was incomparable, and[r]
now it was even greater.[pcms]

*2121|
[fc]
I opened my eyes wide... witnessing the moment my arm was bitten.[pcms]

A familiar voice echoed through the hallway. Then, the owner of that[r]

A screwdriver was stuck in the man's face, right next to his ear. His[r]

Whether it was because of the screwdriver or his own consciousness...[pcms]

In the darkening scenery, I couldn't make the judgment.[pcms]
