After returning to the hotel, Souichirou and I took a shower and[r]
changed into our uniforms.[pcms]

*5224|

I'm not quite sure what kind of seating it will be, but if you're a[r]
student, wearing a uniform should be foolproof.[pcms]

Then, taking the loop bus past the sports center to the cape on the[r]
hill in the port town, we arrived at the Ochi family's main house.[pcms]

Souichirou doesn't seem to care at all, but honestly, I was a bit[r]
taken aback.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5229|
[fc]
I thought I understood quite a bit about Miss Ochi's background, but[r]
now that I'm facing her family home, my legs are freezing up.[pcms]

*5230|
[fc]
First of all, the size of the house's property was unbelievable.[pcms]

*5231|
[fc]
To the right and left, it's all Miss Ochi's house. Naturally, the[r]
mansion inside must be something to behold as well.[pcms]

*5232|
[fc]
And then, this gate.[pcms]

*5233|
[fc]
It's a gate with a grand presence that seems to reject visitors, like[r]
something out of a period drama about a samurai residence.[pcms]

*5234|
[fc]
No half-hearted salesperson would feel up to knocking on this gate.[pcms]

*5235|
[fc]
As I was feeling somewhat intimidated, a familiar face appeared from[r]
inside, Miss Ochi in her uniform, welcoming us.[pcms]

"Fufu, please don't be so formal. It's just a dinner party."[pcms]

*5240|
[fc]
Souichirou seems as usual, but I felt a little stiff.[pcms]

*5241|
[fc]
Somehow, I feel the difference in social status and can't help but[r]
feel intimidated.[pcms]

*5242|
[fc]
If this were another era, calling her a princess would not be an[r]
exaggeration at all.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Oh, no... it's nothing."[pcms]

*5246|
[fc]
Somehow, standing in front of the main gate with Miss Ochi gave me a[r]
sense of dj vu.[pcms]

*5247|
[fc]
I wonder if it's from some anime scene I've seen before.[pcms]

*5248|
[fc]
Unable to recall, I followed Miss Ochi's invitation and entered[r]
through the gate into the mansion.[pcms]

*5249|

Once inside the front yard, I could really feel the vastness of the[r]
mansion.[pcms]

Everything beyond the back gate belongs to Miss Ochi's family home.[pcms]

"Isn't that Senior Minami? So you were invited too."[pcms]

*5254|

From the shade of some well-shaped shrubs, Senior Minami in her[r]

Why is Senior Minami here? Invited? Really?[pcms]

Onee-sama doing such things... that can't be possible, right?[pcms]

Probably...[pcms]

The woman who appeared seemed to be in her thirties, sharp-minded. But[r]

Indeed, she looks more like an older sister than an aunt. She has a[r]
