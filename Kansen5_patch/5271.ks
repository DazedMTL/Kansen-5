I can feel the blood rushing to my head.[pcms]

*3230|
[fc]
And you say that now, after all this? How can such a misunderstanding[r]
be allowed?[pcms]

*3231|
[fc]
Do you think you're so special? Chosen?[pcms]

*3232|
[fc]
You wanted to ask that?[pcms]

*3233|
[fc]
I don't even feel like hearing what conclusion you've reached.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Just like those being torn from their families and killed by them!"[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Miserably, pitifully, throw away your dignity and beg for your life[r]
to protect what little of it remains!"[pcms]

"..."[pcms]

*3240|
[fc]
But Genjirou Maeda kept his stern gaze fixed on me, without so much as[r]
flinching.[pcms]

*3241|
[fc]
Even if he dies here, he'd probably be satisfied.[pcms]

*3242|
[fc]
Drunk on his own script, he'd meet a peaceful death.[pcms]

*3243|
[fc]
But even so, I![pcms]

No one is left to avenge everyone's grudges.[pcms]
