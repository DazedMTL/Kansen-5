[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"This place is always bustling, isn't it?"[pcms]

*713|
[fc]
Shibuya, a town where young people gather.[pcms]

*714|
[fc]
...Of course, it's not just young people.[pcms]

*715|
[fc]
"Even someone called an 'old man' like me is working in this town to[r]
make a living."[pcms]

*716|
[fc]
And right in the heart of it all. Just outside the station.[pcms]

*717|
[fc]
In front of Q-FRONT, I suddenly stopped, my tired eyes drawn to the[r]
mouth of a man displayed on the large screen.[pcms]

*718|
[fc]
[ns]News Caster[nse]
"Today marks the 10th court session at the Tokyo High Court for the[r]
'Tohoku Infection Disaster' lawsuit--"[pcms]

*719|
[fc]
[ns]News Caster[nse]
"The legal team for the families of the infection victims argues that[r]
even after four years, they haven't even--"[pcms]

*720|
[fc]
[ns]News Caster[nse]
"This lawsuit, now in its tenth session, seems to require a long time[r]
to reach a settlement."[pcms]

*721|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"A long time... huh..."[pcms]

*722|
[fc]
The news caster changes, and the topic shifts to tomorrow's weather.[pcms]

*723|
[fc]
Taking that as my cue, I look down at the ground and let out a sigh.[pcms]

*724|
[fc]
[ns]Hirotake[nse]
"...Hmph."[pcms]

*725|
[fc]
No matter how much time is spent, we probably won't reach the truth.[r]
"The person who knows everything has long since vanished into thin[r]
air."[pcms]

*726|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Even me, huh..."[pcms]

*727|
[fc]
No matter how many times I tell myself it's pointless to think about[r]
it anymore.[pcms]

*728|
[fc]
But it's not something you can just give up on so easily.[pcms]

*729|
[fc]
Still-- I'm not young enough to keep chasing just that.[pcms]

*730|
[fc]
It's always like this around this time. I remember that unresolved[r]
incident and feel a sense of emptiness spreading deep within my heart.[pcms]

*731|
[fc]
Suddenly, I glance at my watch tightening around my wrist, and it[r]
points to nine o'clock.[pcms]

*732|
[fc]
I'm no longer young. I don't have the stamina to play around in this[r]
town anymore.[pcms]

*733|
[fc]
Still, my spirit is another story. After all, there are things I have[r]
to do because of my position--[pcms]

*734|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Izubuchi-san, we should be going soon."[pcms]

*735|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"...Yeah."[pcms]

*736|
[fc]
In the midst of the crowd, a familiar voice echoes dully in my weary[r]
head, pulling me back from my attempt to escape reality.[pcms]

*737|
[fc]
Today, I had promised to talk to Saito about what happened four years[r]
ago.[pcms]

*738|
[fc]
Saito knocks on the window of a taxi stopped in front of the station[r]
rotary, urging me to "Please get in quickly."[pcms]

*739|
[fc]
I wasn't keen on it, but it couldn't be helped.[pcms]

*740|
[fc]
Drinking with a subordinate is also part of a boss's duties. Telling[r]
old stories to a subordinate is also part of a boss's duties. Even if[r]
it's bothersome, that's just how it is.[pcms]

*745|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"It's been four years since then..."[pcms]

*746|
[fc]
Saito and I sat at the counter of an elegant bar and lightly clinked[r]
our glasses together.[pcms]

*747|
[fc]
The sound of clear glass disappeared into the depth of the world music[r]
playing in the background.[pcms]

*748|
[fc]
Four years since then... He's concerned about it too. It's impossible[r]
not to be.[pcms]

*749|
[fc]
The real reason he wants to hear is probably something else. And[r]
that's what I'm about to talk about.[pcms]

*750|
[fc]
What he seeks is the reason for my promotion. What I'm going to tell[r]
him comes from a feeling akin to confession.[pcms]

*751|
[fc]
We both have our interests aligned. That's why I push my tired body to[r]
keep him company, and he puts up with an old man like me in return.[pcms]

*752|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Don't be so formal, Saito. Now... let's get to the main topic. What[r]
you want to know is... 'What I did four years ago to get promoted,'[r]
right?"[pcms]

*753|
[fc]
I don't like beating around the bush. Saito might feel the same, but[r]
he's not in a position to say so, nor is he the type of man to say it.[pcms]

*754|
[fc]
But, given my profession, I can't afford to be indirect. I need him to[r]
keep up the good work from here on out.[pcms]

*755|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Well... indeed, that's part of it, but I was also hoping to hear[r]
about your family, your overseas assignments, and such."[pcms]

*756|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Haha... so that's your angle. Not a bad way to listen. But if you're[r]
going to ask about that kind of stuff, you should do your research[r]
beforehand. There are things you shouldn't touch upon."[pcms]

*757|
[fc]
His affability is commendable. It can be a weapon for us.[pcms]

*758|
[fc]
However... his technique for extracting stories still has room for[r]
improvement. Maybe it's better to praise him and help him grow.[pcms]

*759|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"I thought you'd say that, so I did some research on my own. Berlin,[r]
London, Washington D.C.--"[pcms]

*760|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"After working at various branches, you returned to the head office[r]
and now you're the editor-in-chief of our weekly magazine..."[pcms]

*761|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"You're known for your blunt criticism towards the government and[r]
industry, which has made you many enemies but also earned you a lot of[r]
popularity... However, there are criticisms about you being somewhat[r]
lenient towards politicians and others you have connections with..."[pcms]

*762|
[fc]
Hmph... such information can be found all over the internet these[r]
days.[pcms]

*763|
[fc]
It's even listed in the company's documents.[pcms]

*764|
[fc]
Still... It's rare these days to find a young person who takes[r]
initiative before being asked.[pcms]

*765|
[fc]
But is this enough for him to be my subordinate? I fully understand[r]
that it's not good to compare him with myself.[pcms]

*766|
[fc]
He needs to take one more step and dig deeper before our work can[r]
truly begin.[pcms]

*767|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Next, regarding your family composition, I'm sorry if this intrudes[r]
on your privacy, I was hesitant whether it was okay to research[r]
this..."[pcms]

*768|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Oh...?"[pcms]

*769|
[fc]
I couldn't help but let out a voice of surprise.[pcms]

*770|
[fc]
I had no intention of accusing him of invading privacy. What surprised[r]
me was his initiative.[pcms]

*771|
[fc]
To think he even researched my family. I'm not a celebrity, so there[r]
shouldn't be any information on the net. Does that mean he[r]
investigated on his own?[pcms]

*772|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"If I've offended you, I apologize."[pcms]

*773|
[fc]
[ns]Hirotake[nse]
"It's fine, continue."[pcms]

*774|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Understood. So... your family consists of your wife and son, three[r]
people in total. Your home is in Shoto... I chose this place thinking[r]
it would be convenient for you to return home."[pcms]

*775|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"I'm pretty considerate, aren't I?"[pcms]

*776|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Well, anyone in the company would know where you live. Now... here's[r]
the information I've gathered on my own. ...though you probably[r]
already know it."[pcms]

*777|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Perhaps... does your son have a classmate who is related to some big[r]
shot?"[pcms]

*778|
[fc]
I was genuinely impressed by Saito's words and started thinking about[r]
how to sidestep this issue.[pcms]

*779|
[fc]
What he's saying is almost correct. However... revealing it would[r]
bring trouble to Souichirou as well.[pcms]

*780|
[fc]
I want him to have a normal youth. To live a life unrelated to walking[r]
through people's noise without covering his ears, unlike me.[pcms]

*781|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"You've got potential, kid. But unfortunately, you're wrong. My kid's[r]
just surrounded by normal kids."[pcms]

*782|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"If anything... there's a kid who got involved in an incident four[r]
years ago. But even that kid is just... normal."[pcms]

*783|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"I see... understood."[pcms]

*784|
[fc]
The cheerful Saito's face clouded over with my words, and he hung his[r]
head.[pcms]

*785|
[fc]
[ns]Hirotake[nse]
"Then let's talk about what you want to know. The reason for my[r]
promotion... about Genjiro Maeda. ...Ah, but before that. Your[r]
questioning was quite good."[pcms]

*786|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Thank you very much! Then Mr. Hiromu, please proceed!"[pcms]

*787|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Ah... well, given how our conversation went, you probably already[r]
know. I pursued Genjiro Maeda because I believed he was involved in[r]
the incident four years ago. That led to my promotion--"[pcms]

*788|
[fc]
...but I couldn't catch him in the end. That's something I regret...[pcms]

*789|
[fc]
A moment of silence.[pcms]

*790|
[fc]
The slightly drunk Hiromu and Saito didn't look at each other but[r]
stared at the wall of bottles behind the counter.[pcms]

*791|
[fc]
I still regret not being able to catch him. If I had cornered him back[r]
then, the class-action lawsuit would have moved towards resolution[r]
much sooner.[pcms]

*792|
[fc]
Nakazawa Makoto and Saito remained silent, as time slowly passed by.[pcms]

*793|
[fc]
Perhaps sensing the mood, the bartender inside the counter discreetly[r]
disappeared from our view.[pcms]

*794|
[fc]
As if that was a signal, my mouth began to move as if a dam had[r]
broken.[pcms]

*795|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"A native of Akita with cabinet experience... a man who climbed his[r]
way up to Chief Cabinet Secretary. It's only natural we'd know that,[r]
being in our line of work. And then... ah yes, he had an unusual[r]
fondness for soba."[pcms]

*796|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"But I digress. He married a daughter from a distinguished family on[r]
Oogamijima. Her name was Ochi Minayo... his lawful wife."[pcms]

*797|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"...She passed away soon after giving birth to their first son. After[r]
several miscarriages, they finally had a child, only for her to die[r]
shortly after. It must have been a bitter regret."[pcms]

*798|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"The first son's name is Ichihiro... he used to live in this Shoto[r]
area. He worked as Genjiro Maeda's secretary. One might say he was[r]
somewhat naive, but it seems he was trying to make this country a[r]
better place."[pcms]

*799|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"But... his life was cut short in the midst of his endeavors. A car[r]
accident. Human fate can be so fleeting."[pcms]

*800|
[fc]
Having spoken too much at once, I swirled the glass in my hand and[r]
moistened my dry lips to take a breath.[pcms]

*801|
[fc]
Saito is looking at me with eyes that seem eager to hear more. It[r]
seems he's willing to indulge my monologue for now.[pcms]

*802|
[fc]
...Someday, I'd like to have a talk like this with Souichirou. I[r]
wonder what kind of face he'll make then.[pcms]

*803|
[fc]
Children, huh...[pcms]

*804|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"There are other children as well. A boy and a girl, one of each. They[r]
would be the eldest daughter and the second son, I suppose."[pcms]

*805|
[fc]
[ns]Hirotake[nse]
"Their names are Kazuo and Chuo. Both are excellent and still alive...[r]
Well, I haven't looked into it more than that."[pcms]

*806|
[fc]
I took out a cigarette from my breast pocket, lit it, and inhaled the[r]
purple smoke deep into my lungs.[pcms]

*807|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"...Speaking of which, Genjiro Maeda was quite an anti-smoker. Even[r]
with the cigarettes in my breast pocket, he could tell by the smell."[pcms]

*808|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Speaking of cigarettes, one of the related figures is Colonel Peter[r]
Nelson. Always with a cigar in his mouth... He was like a character[r]
out of a movie."[pcms]

*809|
[fc]
I lifted the cigarette that had turned to ash in the ashtray and[r]
slowly inhaled the smoke.[pcms]

*810|
[fc]
Perhaps due to the alcohol and fatigue, even though it's an action[r]
I've repeated for years, my head spins.[pcms]

*811|
[fc]
To calm myself down, I slowly close my eyes.[pcms]

*812|
[fc]
Genjiro, the Colonel... And then, Major General MacLintock...[pcms]

*813|
[fc]
The faces of those I had chased after resurface in my mind like images[r]
filtered through a purple haze.[pcms]

*814|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"The Colonel is no longer in this world. Nor is Major General[r]
MacLintock, who was likely pulling his strings..."[pcms]

*815|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Major General MacLintock...? Wasn't he arrested a while back for a[r]
minor virus leak incident?"[pcms]

*816|
[fc]
Until now, Saito had been quietly listening to my soliloquy, but as[r]
soon as I mentioned the Major General's name, he leaned forward[r]
excitedly.[pcms]

*817|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"That's right. He's said to have died of illness in prison..."[pcms]

*818|
[fc]
They were probably "erased." But that's just my speculation. Without[r]
solid evidence, it's not something one can assert lightly.[pcms]

*819|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Colonel Nelson held considerable power within the army. That was[r]
because he had the backing of Major General MacLintock."[pcms]

*820|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Major General MacLintock belonged to the U.S. Army Medical Research[r]
Institute of Infectious Diseases... It's a bit of a leap, but his[r]
father ran a trading company."[pcms]

*821|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"And that connects to Genjiro Maeda. The three of them had some sort[r]
of relationship with each other. That's as far as I could[r]
investigate."[pcms]

*822|
[fc]
It's mostly circumstantial evidence. They were not just "somehow"[r]
connected; they were "connected."[pcms]

*823|
[fc]
The virus was created by Major General MacLintock. His main purpose[r]
was ostensibly to enhance epidemic prevention capabilities. In[r]
reality, it was the military application of that virus.[pcms]

*824|
[fc]
His subordinate, Colonel Peter Nelson. He brought the virus created by[r]
the Major General into this country.[pcms]

*825|
[fc]
And then there's Genjiro Maeda. Concerned about the current state of[r]
our country and trying to change it. It was clear they were connected.[pcms]

*826|
[fc]
They were the culprits behind the disaster four years ago. There's no[r]
doubt about it.[pcms]

*827|
[fc]
It's unforgivable, but it's no longer possible to question them about[r]
it.[pcms]

*828|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"The military men never opened their mouths, and Genjiro Maeda retired[r]
from politics due to a scandal that was set up against him."[pcms]

*829|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"He seems to be living in retirement on Oogamijima, but unless you're[r]
a very close acquaintance, you're not allowed to meet him. Rumor has[r]
it he can barely speak properly now."[pcms]

*830|
[fc]
The most... That girl from the same academy as Souichirou...[pcms]

*831|
[fc]
Ochi Akari was her name. If I ask her, I might be able to get some[r]
information.[pcms]

*832|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"It's ironic, isn't it, this thing called fate..."[pcms]

*833|
[fc]
Just when we're close to the truth, fate plays its tricks.[pcms]

*834|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"Eh? What's wrong?"[pcms]

*835|
[fc]
[ns]Hirotake[nse]
"Ah, it's nothing... just talking to myself."[pcms]

*836|
[fc]
What will become of the girl named Akari when that happens?[pcms]

*837|
[fc]
If she finds out that one of her own family members was the mastermind[r]
behind an incident that could overturn a country.[pcms]

*838|
[fc]
What would Souichirou, who is close to that girl, think?[pcms]

*839|
[fc]
By my hand, innocent young people may be thrown into the midst of[r]
turmoil.[pcms]

*840|
[fc]
To hurt the hearts of young people with a future, just to find out a[r]
trivial matter, is something I can't do now.[pcms]

*841|
[fc]
Souichirou is getting along with that girl. That's what's stopping me.[pcms]

*842|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"...Sorry, let's leave it at that for today. I'm oddly drunk. I might[r]
say something unnecessary based on speculation."[pcms]

*843|
[fc]
[ns]Saito[nse]
"...I don't mind. There might be a hint in there."[pcms]

*844|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"Hahaha... you're reliable. But give me a break... I'm getting tired."[pcms]

*845|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"I'll be going home soon. It's time to 'play' the role of a family-[r]
loving... good father. Haha..."[pcms]

*846|
[fc]
I patted Saito, who looked unsatisfied, on the shoulder and told the[r]
bartender it was time to pay.[pcms]

*847|
[fc]
[ns]Hiromu[nse]
"I'll go ahead as an apology. Put it on my tab. Drink as much as you[r]
want. Sorry... I'll be leaving first."[pcms]

*848|
[fc]
Saito kept bowing in place until I left the store.[pcms]

*850|
[fc]
Talking to Saito actually helped relieve some of my fatigue.[r]
Furthermore, my feelings of repentance have eased. Of course, that[r]
might just be for now.[pcms]

*851|
[fc]
The truth is something no one can grasp. That's the only thing I can[r]
think of.[pcms]

*852|
[fc]
No matter how much we pursue it, we can't catch up.[pcms]

*853|
[fc]
The truth... will be buried with the victims in their graves, never to[r]

That summer...[pcms]

After four summers, it all ended.[pcms]
