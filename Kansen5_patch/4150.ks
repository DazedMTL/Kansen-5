I descended from the rooftop entrance to the VIP room floor.[pcms]

This place was a world apart from the previous noise, unaffected by[r]
groans, screams, or moans, and there was no sign of any infected.[pcms]

Faintly, I could hear people's voices from ahead. As we moved further,[r]
the voices became clearer, and I realized it was two men conversing.[pcms]

Two men in black suits were standing with their backs to us. Facing[r]

I recognized one of the men in black. He was definitely the one who[r]

The atmosphere inside the room was tense. The mere presence of a gun[r]
