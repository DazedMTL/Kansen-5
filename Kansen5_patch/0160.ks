The movie was a Swedish film about a love story between a vampire girl[r]

The vampire girl kills the bullies, saving the protagonist... but[r]
something doesn't quite sit right.[pcms]

*1608|
[fc]
In the last scene, the protagonist, who has no place at home or[r]
school, leaves town with the vampire girl, and it's indescribably[r]
poignant.[pcms]

*1609|
[fc]
He finds a new place to belong and someone important to him; it looks[r]
like a happy ending... but there seems to be a twist.[pcms]

*1612|
[fc]
The vampire girl had a foster father, but their relationship was far[r]
from good.[pcms]

*1613|
[fc]
He probably met her in a similar way to the protagonist and lived with[r]
her, but their relationship was like that of a couple in a period of[r]
ennui.[pcms]

What will happen to the protagonist and the vampire girl in the future[r]
is directly foreshadowed.[pcms]

"If only the relationship between that foster father and the girl had[r]
been more intimate."[pcms]

*1618|
[fc]
Though he's called a foster father, his existence as the vampire's[r]
servant didn't seem very favorable.[pcms]

*1619|
[fc]
In the middle of the movie, the foster father dies, and it's[r]
frustrating because it feels like the girl is just getting a new[r]

"If you start doubting that, then the girl becomes a being of self-[r]

If there was no emotional connection, then it just becomes a story[r]
about the girl acquiring a new servant.[pcms]

*1623|

The fact that love can change and foreshadowing that shift in feelings[r]
made for an unpleasant narrative device.[pcms]
