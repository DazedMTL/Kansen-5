The newspaper and photography clubs opted for rental cycling as an[r]
item that allowed them to move without worrying about time, rather[r]
than waiting for a bus that comes once or twice an hour.[pcms]

*4537|
[fc]
By the second day of the camp, everyone had grown impatient with the[r]
inconvenience and rented bicycles.[pcms]

*4538|
[fc]
However, Senior Frank was the only one who didn't rent a bike because[r]
he brought his skateboard.[pcms]

*4539|
[fc]
That doesn't mean he skates back to the hotel from the sports center.[pcms]

*4540|

He just takes the bus back with the other members.[pcms]

*4541|

I don't understand what he means by using his skateboard as an excuse;[r]
maybe there's a reason he can't ride a bike.[pcms]

The Shiokaze Highway allows for crossing by car, express bus, and even[r]
bicycle, and if one is so inclined, it's possible to traverse on foot[r]
as well.[pcms]

*4543|
[fc]
It's popular among road racers, and on Ojima Island, they rent out[r]
mamachari bikes for travelers.[pcms]

*4544|
[fc]
The bikes we rented were of this type, and you could return them at[r]
any station regardless of where you borrowed them from.[pcms]

*4545|
[fc]
For these three days, we've been commuting between the hotel and[r]
sports center on these bikes.[pcms]

*4546|
[fc]
The distance is roughly 8 to 10 kilometers.[pcms]

*4547|
[fc]
It's not much on flat ground, but since there are three steep hills to[r]
overcome, it was quite a tough journey.[pcms]

*4548|
[fc]
Especially at night, visibility is poor and it's dangerous.[pcms]

*4549|
[fc]
It would have been better if it were the other way around; being tired[r]

Well, even so, when I think about Ochi-san and others who were[r]
constantly on the move, it doesn't seem like much.[pcms]

I think it takes about 50 minutes to get from Onomichi to Ojima Island[r]
by connecting buses.[pcms]

the hotel before Onee-san.[pcms]

That pupil... was red.[pcms]

It wasn't stained by the blood that had spurted out; it was originally[r]
red.[pcms]

More than the fact that a person had died, those red eyes stuck in my[r]
mind and wouldn't leave.[pcms]

These eyes... these eyes are...[pcms]

The moment the figure stumbled, their body was struck by an oncoming[r]
SUV and sent flying with a dull sound into the air.[pcms]

The moment they were hit, it was too fast for the naked eye to catch,[r]
but the time they spent flying through the air felt abnormally long.[pcms]

And then, the figure that flew towards us in front of the bus stop[r]
collided with the windshield of a large transport truck passing in the[r]
opposite lane, creating a grand spray of blood.[pcms]

The figure soared right above the lined-up students.[pcms]

*4619|

The bright red liquid scattered everywhere.[pcms]

*4620|
[fc]
Before anyone could react, the figure fell onto a small, short-[r]
statured body as if leaning on it.[pcms]

*4621|
[fc]
Whether it was a reflex or out of innate kindness, the small-bodied[r]
girl embraced the figure as if to support it.[pcms]

*4622|

Covered in blood from head to toe and staining her clothes with[r]
bloodstains, only her small body slowly laid the figure down on the[r]
ground.[pcms]

From the head of the figure that had been smashed against the asphalt,[r]
a bright red liquid was spilling out.[pcms]

The head was so deformed that an eyeball seemed to be pushed out,[r]
popping out.[pcms]

It seemed to fixate on me, as if it was making eye contact.[pcms]
