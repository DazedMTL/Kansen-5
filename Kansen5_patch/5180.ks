We arrived at the remains of an old Japanese military artillery[r]
battery, peeking inside and organizing our belongings as we prepared[r]
to move forward.[pcms]

*2352|
[fc]
The world outside the hotel was already enveloped in night, indicating[r]
that I had been unconscious for quite a long time.[pcms]

*2353|
[fc]
It would have been best to drive to Miss Ochi's family home, but with[r]
abandoned cars scattered everywhere, it was simply impossible.[pcms]

*2354|
[fc]
But with infected people wandering around, even walking the shortest[r]
distance was difficult.[pcms]

*2355|
[fc]
I no longer felt pain from the wound on my arm. Instead, I felt a[r]
ticklish sense of comfort.[pcms]

*2356|
[fc]
If things continue like this, I'll soon become one of them. I'll[r]
attack everyone without understanding anything, sacrificing a few[r]
before being killed myself.[pcms]

*2357|
[fc]
To avoid such a future, I have no choice but to keep moving forward as[r]
long as there's hope.[pcms]

*2358|
[fc]
Yet... for some reason, everyone was dressed in a surprisingly relaxed[r]
manner.[pcms]

*2359|
[fc]
Our clothes got dirty from the commotion since morning, so they must[r]
have picked out whatever was available from the hotel store...[pcms]

Sis was dressed in a ten-gallon hat, long boots, a belt with a fur[r]
muffler, and a bikinian outfit befitting the heroine of a sexy action[r]
game.[pcms]

[fc]
Miss Ochi was in her familiar jersey outfit, but underneath she wore a[r]
white school swimsuit.[pcms]

*2369|
[fc]
It's supposed to be white as a substitute for underwear, but at[r]
Tarja's school, are school swimsuits white...?[pcms]

*2370|
[fc]
Or was that store just niche? White swimsuits should be transparent[r]
when photographed, yet...[pcms]

*2371|
[fc]
Moreover, in her hand was a real naginata passed down from Mr. Kazuo.[pcms]

*2372|
[fc]
If she ever had to wear a swimsuit, the combination with the naginata[r]
would be too mismatched...[pcms]

Senior Minami was dressed in a uniform with spats, which also felt[r]
somewhat out of place.[pcms]

It's much better compared to Sis, but still odd.[pcms]

She might have chosen that outfit consciously.[pcms]

They were heading towards the hotel, Tarja-san's school, and the[r]
