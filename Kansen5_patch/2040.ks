I snapped awake. It felt like I heard a scream from somewhere...[pcms]

*510|
[fc]
I strained my ears for a while, but I couldn't hear anything, not even[r]
a voice, let alone a scream. Maybe it was just my imagination...[pcms]

*511|
[fc]
Although I didn't hear a scream, I could hear cute, soft breathing[r]
coming from right next to me.[pcms]

*512|
[fc]
Senior Minami seems to be fast asleep. I can't help but be captivated[r]
by her beautiful sleeping face.[pcms]

*513|
[fc]
Beautiful women are still beautiful even when they're asleep. It's my[r]
first time seeing a girl's sleeping face up close like this, but I'm[r]
sure it's the best in the world.[pcms]

*514|
[fc]
The sound of her breathing gently tickles my ears, and the sweet scent[r]
drifting inside the tent fills my lungs.[pcms]

*515|
[fc]
It's the smell of Senior Minami's body fluids. It's sweet and sour,[r]
rich, and well, it's exactly what you'd call the scent of pheromones.[pcms]

*516|
[fc]
Sex is really something else. It's nothing compared to masturbation.[pcms]

*517|
[fc]
It's not just any girl, Senior Minami was amazing. What's amazing is[r]
that voluptuous body that you wouldn't expect from her usual[r]
appearance.[pcms]

*518|
[fc]
Her bountiful breasts are incredible, but so is her tight butt. And of[r]
course, her pussy too. Everything was amazing.[pcms]

*519|
[fc]
I wonder if it's because she swims. Not just swimming, but girls who[r]
do some kind of sport seem to know how to use their bodies.[pcms]

*520|
[fc]
Because they can freely control their bodies with their will, they[r]
seem to know how to draw out pleasure...[pcms]

*521|
[fc]
I wonder if Ochi-san is the same...[pcms]

*522|
[fc]
I feel a little like I've betrayed her. But even though she looks up[r]
to me, we're not lovers, and besides... it would be a shame for a man[r]
to pass up an opportunity like this.[pcms]

*523|
[fc]
No... it's just an excuse.[pcms]

*524|
[fc]
Feeling a prickling in my heart, I shook my head vigorously to cast[r]
Ochi-san out of my thoughts.[pcms]

*525|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*526|
[fc]
My body feels heavy, but it's a pleasant kind of fatigue. Thank[r]
goodness the camp resumes in the afternoon today.[pcms]

*527|
[fc]
It's still before dawn. If I sleep next to Senior Minami until around[r]
noon, my strength should be fully restored.[pcms]

*528|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Ah!"[pcms]

*529|
[fc]
...This is bad.[pcms]

*530|
[fc]
"A couple having sex at a campsite" is exactly like a death flag in a[r]
horror movie.[pcms]

*531|
[fc]
Damn... I've set it up... What if a hockey-masked killer shows up?[pcms]

*532|
[fc]
With my strength completely drained like this, I'm sure I'd definitely[r]
be killed.[pcms]

*533|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*534|
[fc]
No, no, this is the real world, not a movie. It's not like setting up[r]
a flag in a game...[pcms]

*535|
[fc]
It'll be fine. There's no way that could happen. ...Right?[r]
...Right...?[pcms]

*536|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*537|
[fc]
That ominous premonition has stuck in my mind. Thinking I need a[r]
change of pace, I decide to go to the convenience store.[pcms]

*538|
[fc]
I was skeptical about having one right next to the campsite, but it's[r]
certainly convenient that the store is open even at this hour.[pcms]

*539|
[fc]
...I wonder if she'll let me have sex with her again if I go buy more[r]
condoms...[pcms]

*540|
[fc]
Feeling slightly better and excited at the thought, I quietly slipped[r]
out of the tent so as not to wake Senior Minami.[pcms]

*541|
[fc]
Outside it was still dim, but not as dark as deep night, and I could[r]
vaguely make out objects. With some streetlights here and there, I[r]
should be able to get to the convenience store without any problems.[pcms]

*542|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*543|
[fc]
Still, a lot has happened today.[pcms]

*544|
[fc]
It started with dinner at the mansion and then the revelation that[r]
Ochi-san's family was involved in that incident.[pcms]

*545|
[fc]
And then... there was Senior Minami's confession. That she had the[r]
same virginity as me...[pcms]

*546|
[fc]
The rumors being half true was honestly a shock, but Senior Minami[r]
lost her entire family and ended up completely alone in the world.[pcms]

*547|
[fc]
Seeing sex as a means of pleasure and playing around with men might be[r]
because she was left all alone as a survivor of that epidemic.[pcms]

*548|
[fc]
Perhaps she chose sex as the quickest way to interact with people.[pcms]

"Kyaaah...!"[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Huh?!"[pcms]

*551|
[fc]
A scream? I involuntarily stopped in my tracks. I couldn't tell where[r]
it came from, but I definitely heard it.[pcms]

*552|
[fc]
I thought I woke up because of a scream, and it turns out I really did[r]
hear one.[pcms]

*554|
[fc]
I strained my ears, trying to figure out where it came from.[pcms]

*555|
[fc]
But even after standing still for a while, the scream did not come[r]
again, and I couldn't hear anything else at all.[pcms]

*556|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"...Ah"[pcms]

*557|
[fc]
Maybe that scream was actually a moan. Maybe it's the erotic voice of[r]
someone having sex somewhere...[pcms]

*558|
[fc]
That means... maybe everyone could hear me and Senior Minami too...[r]
from outside? Ugh, that's a bit embarrassing...[pcms]

*559|
[fc]
I started walking again, feeling my face flush with embarrassment.[r]
Thank goodness it's still dim outside.[pcms]

*560|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*561|
[fc]
Senior Minami said we're like comrades... The moment I saw her[r]
barcode, I felt a strange sense of kinship, or a greater sense of[r]
closeness than before.[pcms]

*562|
[fc]
Since she knew about my barcode, she might have continued to feel the[r]
same way.[pcms]

*563|
[fc]
If that's the case... it might be presumptuous of me, but maybe I[r]
could truly support Senior Minami.[pcms]

*564|
[fc]
Onee-san and Souichi know about my situation. Both are good confidants[r]
and important to me, but...[pcms]

*565|
[fc]
I'm sure they can't truly understand this loneliness and sense of void[r]
I feel deep down... the sensation as if my life has been abruptly[r]
severed.[pcms]

*566|
[fc]
It's a feeling only those who have experienced it firsthand can[r]
understand.[pcms]

*567|
[fc]
But Senior Minami, being in the same situation, would understand me,[r]
and I think I can comprehend her loneliness and feelings as well.[pcms]

*568|
[fc]
I think I can fill the void she's been trying to cover with flings[r]
with men and support her.[pcms]

*569|
[fc]
I don't want this to end with just tonight... not just the sex, but[r]
everything with Senior Minami.[pcms]

*570|
[fc]
As I pondered these things, my gaze naturally fell to the ground.[pcms]

*571|
[fc]
Feeling as if I had found an answer, I looked up and saw a white,[r]
blurry mass in the distance.[pcms]

*572|
[fc]
For a moment, I was scared it might be a ghost, but on closer[r]
inspection, it seemed to be a person crouching down.[pcms]

*573|
[fc]
Driven by curiosity about what they were doing, I decided to get[r]
closer.[pcms]

*574|
[fc]
Sure enough, there was someone in pale clothing crouched down, and in[r]
front of them, someone else was lying down.[pcms]

*575|
[fc]
Could it be someone who suddenly fell ill? Despite my hesitation, I[r]
decided to approach and call out to them. Maybe I could help.[pcms]

*576|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Excuse me... what happened?"[pcms]

*577|
[fc]
When I got closer, I realized that the crouching person was a woman.[r]
She was wearing something strange and shiny, like a white raincoat.[pcms]

*578|
[fc]
It's summer; isn't she hot? It hasn't even rained.[pcms]

*579|
[fc]
As I wondered about this, the woman finally seemed to notice me and[r]
turned around.[pcms]

*580|
[fc]
Her hair was a bit disheveled, but she seemed quite beautiful. She[r]
somehow reminded me of Senior Minami...[pcms]

I desperately covered my mouth with both hands to stop myself from[r]

light of a distant streetlamp.[pcms]

In the faint light, there was no mistaking the eerie color of her[r]
eyes.[pcms]

unsteadily in the dim light.[pcms]

I put some spirit into my trembling knees. Although my steps were[r]
