The hot shower water gives warmth to my body, chilled by sweat and air[r]
conditioning.[pcms]

*3927|
[fc]
Tarja-san was also one of the people hurt by that incident. Moreover,[r]
she's still struggling, unable to shake off her past.[pcms]

*3928|
[fc]
I think there are probably many others with similar wounds,[r]
overflowing throughout Japan.[pcms]

*3929|

In the four years since that incident, there are countless people in[r]
Japan whose lives have changed completely...[pcms]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Ngggaaah...gagaaah...bugh"[pcms]

*3931|
[fc]
When I stepped out of the shower, I could hear Souichirou's loud[r]
snoring.[pcms]

*3932|
[fc]
It seems he's fallen asleep. It's understandable, given the fatigue[r]
from our journey and the hard day we've had.[pcms]

*3933|
[fc]
Looking at the TV that was left on, it was broadcasting news about the[r]
tenth Tohoku Epidemic lawsuit.[pcms]

*3934|
[fc]
The anger and sadness of the plaintiffs who lost their families,[r]
fortunes, and hope for living were palpable through the screen.[pcms]

*3935|
[fc]
While the world may be moving on from that incident, there are[r]
certainly those who cannot find an end to it.[pcms]

*3936|
[fc]
I understand the feelings of those who want to speak of new hopes for[r]
the future, but it's not that simple.[pcms]

*3937|
[fc]
I turned off the TV and lay down on the bed, trying to calm the[r]
turmoil in my chest.[pcms]

*3938|
[fc]
To live, people must always prepare for the next stage.[pcms]

*3939|
[fc]
Being born, loved by family, making friends, going to school, working,[r]
marriage, childbirth, retirement, old age...[pcms]

*3940|
[fc]
Even while living in the present, it has become normal for people to[r]
constantly prepare for what comes next.[pcms]

*3941|
[fc]
Wishing for nothing to change is like a dream or an illusion.[pcms]

*3942|
[fc]
But for me, the next stage prepared was separation from my family and[r]
a new life in a different environment.[pcms]

*3943|
[fc]
Those who can't choose their next stage are generally forced into an[r]
unhappy life.[pcms]

*3944|
[fc]
It's the same with crimes, accidents, or disasters.[pcms]

*3945|
[fc]
The idea of someone imposing happiness on another is a tale that only[r]
exists in stories.[pcms]

*3946|
[fc]
But do I really need to suffer for the rest of my life? Even someone[r]
like me will surely face the next stage.[pcms]

*3947|
[fc]
No matter how unfortunate a person is, new stages will continue to[r]
appear until they die.[pcms]

*3948|
[fc]
I think Tarja-san will eventually realize this too.[pcms]

*3949|
[fc]
If she can't come to realize it and chooses to remain stuck in[r]
place...[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*3952|
[fc]
Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep and now Souichirou's snoring,[r]
shaking the air around us, seems to have woken me up.[pcms]

*3953|
[fc]
I feel like I was thinking about something depressing, but listening[r]
to Souichirou's snoring made it seem trivial.[pcms]

*3954|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Nggogugawagaa...bugigugagabugwaa..."[pcms]

*3955|
[fc]
However, this snoring is seriously loud.[pcms]

*3956|
[fc]
I'm thinking he should probably visit an otolaryngologist; it's that[r]
bad.[pcms]

*3957|
[fc]
Maybe I should put a wet towel over his face.[pcms]

*3958|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*3959|
[fc]
I'm completely awake now.[pcms]

*3960|
[fc]
Trying to sleep now would be futile with his snoring getting in the[r]
way.[pcms]

*3961|
[fc]
Starting tomorrow, I'll have to fall asleep before Souichirou and[r]
stuff some earplugs in to avoid this trouble.[pcms]

*3962|
[fc]
Maybe I should go out for a walk in the night air? It might make me[r]
sleepy.[pcms]

*3963|
[fc]
I got out of bed and left the room as if fleeing from this snoring[r]
machine.[pcms]

*3964|
[fc]
Once in the hallway, a silence so profound it caused my ears to ring[r]
assaulted me.[pcms]

*3965|
[fc]
There are no teachers on patrol, and no students out chatting and[r]
walking around.[pcms]

*3966|
[fc]
They must be tired and have gone to sleep by now.[pcms]

*3967|
[fc]
I started wandering aimlessly inside the hotel without any particular[r]
destination in mind.[pcms]

*3968|
[fc]
It's a brand-new hotel, so naturally, I couldn't find any dirt or wear[r]
anywhere I looked.[pcms]

*3969|
[fc]
It's probably the first time anyone has stayed on this floor, but it[r]
seems like it won't look much different even ten years from now.[pcms]

*3970|
[fc]
The familiar emergency lamps cast a green glow, illuminating the[r]
ceiling.[pcms]

*3971|
[fc]
Upon closer inspection, I found the locations of emergency stairways,[r]
evacuation routes, and escape chutes marked on the wall.[pcms]

*3972|
[fc]
It seems there's an emergency staircase or ladder behind this door.[pcms]

*3973|
[fc]
When I walked over to the elevator, I found a map of the hotel there.[pcms]

*3974|
[fc]
The atrium shopping floors from the first to the third floor are[r]
closed, but it seems I can get to the convenience store from the[r]
entrance hall.[pcms]

*3975|
[fc]
I'd like to drink a Mountain Dew if they have it. Plus, I might be[r]
able to kill some time with some magazine browsing.[pcms]

*3976|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Hmm...?"[pcms]

*3977|
[fc]
Looking closely at the map, I noticed that the rooftop garden is open[r]
even late at night.[pcms]

*3978|
[fc]
I seem to remember researching that this is one of the hotel's selling[r]
points.[pcms]

*3979|
[fc]
Since I'm here, I might as well check out the rooftop garden at night.[r]
I pressed the elevator button to go up and waited for the car to[r]
arrive.[pcms]

*3980|
[fc]
The rooftop garden was so impressive that it was hard to believe it[r]
was man-made.[pcms]

*3981|
[fc]
Neatly trimmed low bushes stood in rows, and flowers bloomed lushly as[r]
if growing wild.[pcms]

*3982|
[fc]
I could even hear the sound of a waterfall and a babbling brook from[r]
afar, which speaks to the level of detail put into it.[pcms]

*3983|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Phew..."[pcms]

*3984|
[fc]
The cold night breeze blowing through from the sea pleasantly cooled[r]
down my heated body.[pcms]

[fc]
In the distance, I could see small lights scattered here and there,[r]
illuminating the entire view of Setouchi Inland Sea.[pcms]

*3986|
[fc]
It's hard to gauge distances at night, but those lights must be quite[r]
far away.[pcms]

*3987|
[fc]
Seeing a scene like this really makes me feel like I'm on a journey.[pcms]

*3988|
[fc]
I spent some time aimlessly gazing at the night view.[pcms]

Carried by the night wind, I thought I heard a strange voice.[pcms]

*3992|
[fc]
What kind of voice was that? Was it a woman? Are they doing something[r]
erotic?[pcms]

I walked quietly towards the direction of the voice, taking care not[r]

*3997|
[fc]
There was Ochi-san, looking dignified in her hakama, practicing with[r]
her naginata which was rumored to be sharp.[pcms]

*3998|
[fc]
I wonder if naginatas are sharp enough to cut; is that one real? Or is[r]
there a safer practice version?[pcms]

*3999|
[fc]
She should be tired from cheerleading practice, but she doesn't seem[r]
to be slacking off in this practice either.[pcms]

*4000|
[fc]
No one is watching, so she wouldn't get scolded for slacking off, yet[r]
she silently swings her naginata and seems to be sweating from it.[pcms]

*4001|
[fc]
She adjusts her stance, then swings up and strikes down.[pcms]

*4002|
[fc]
It seems like there are several patterns to her movements, and she's[r]
doing some sort of repetitive practice over and over again.[pcms]

*4003|
[fc]
In the beautiful night garden, Ochi-san swings her glittering blade[r]
and lets out cute kiai shouts.[pcms]

I found myself completely engrossed in watching Ochi-san's figure,[r]

It would be a shame to just walk away now. I emerged from the shadows[r]

I'd like to enjoy chatting with her.[pcms]

Ochi-san looks puzzled, but that guy is dangerous.[pcms]

Given his detailed knowledge of the Ochi household, it's safe to[r]

He probably wouldn't do anything too rash, but the idea of him[r]

What does she mean by "besides"? If she says something like, "I can't[r]

*4231|
[fc]
And then, as I was about to press my lips against Ochi-san's...[pcms]

Just as I was about to do so, a rumbling sound came from below our[r]
stomachs.[pcms]

We both involuntarily blushed and froze.[pcms]

[vo_aka s="akari0138"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"Eh? Me? Was it me?!"[pcms]

*4235|
[fc]
Ochi-san looks like she might flee somewhere with the momentum of[r]
escaping reality.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak2_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ak07"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4236|

[vo_aka s="akari0139"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"No way, why, it's not like that"[pcms]

*4237|
[fc]
It wasn't me. So it must be Ochi-san.[pcms]

*4238|
[fc]
But I can't really say that. After all, anyone's stomach can rumble.[pcms]

*4239|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Sorry, I think it was me."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak2_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ak10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4240|

[vo_aka s="akari0140"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*4241|
[fc]
What a mess. Just when there was a chance, the mood is completely gone[r]
now.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*4242|
[fc]
And as I was frantically trying to find a thread to pick up the[r]
conversation, Ochi-san started talking about something completely[r]
unrelated, as if to pretend that none of this had ever happened.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4243|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0141"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"So, so, you see, I'm going to the main family's house on the 18th,[r]
and if it's okay with you, would you like to join us for dinner?"[pcms]

*4244|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0142"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"My aunt who lives in the main house will be there, of course, and my[r]
uncle is also planning to come."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4245|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0143"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"I'm sure there will be a lot of treats, but I think it might be too[r]
much to eat all by ourselves..."[pcms]

*4246|
[fc]
Watching Ochi-san rapidly fire off topic after topic, I felt guilty[r]
for having embarrassed her.[pcms]

*4247|
[fc]
If I hadn't been thinking weird things, she wouldn't have had to feel[r]
embarrassed.[pcms]

*4248|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Yeah, sure, I'll take you up on your kind invitation."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak03"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4249|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0144"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"Really?! I'm so happy!"[pcms]

*4250|
[fc]
There's the Monbass event and other family gatherings, and I'm not[r]
sure about butting in as an outsider, but I can't really turn down an[r]
invitation like this.[pcms]

*4251|
[fc]
Dinner shouldn't overlap with other events in terms of time, and if[r]
there's going to be a feast, that means a lot of people will be[r]
coming.[pcms]

*4252|
[fc]
Adding one or two more people into the mix shouldn't make much of a[r]
difference.[pcms]

*4253|
[fc]
Besides, meeting Ochi-san's relatives is pretty much like meeting the[r]
parents of your significant other.[pcms]

*4254|
[fc]
Turning it down would be out of the question![pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4255|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0145"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"That's right, let's invite Arai-senpai and Izubuchi-senpai too."[pcms]

*4256|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Eh..."[pcms]

*4257|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0146"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"If we start eating together, Arai-senpai might start getting along[r]
with us too."[pcms]

*4258|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"You think so...?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4259|
[fc]
Since they're having a dispute over Ochi-san, it seems like it might[r]
actually have the opposite effect.[pcms]

*4260|
[fc]
But Ochi-san doesn't seem to realize that...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak08"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4261|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0147"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"By the way, how about your sister? It would be great if she could[r]
come along too."[pcms]

*4262|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Ah-, my sister... I'm not sure. It depends on her Summer Fest[r]
schedule."[pcms]

*4263|
[fc]
If her favorite band is playing at 5 PM or something, it's probably[r]
impossible.[pcms]

*4264|
[fc]
I haven't looked into it that much, so I won't know unless I ask her.[pcms]

*4265|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0148"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"Is that so... But I'd be happy if she could come."[pcms]
[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak1_dou"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_ak01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4266|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Yeah, I'd like to treat my sister to some delicious food."[pcms]

*4267|
[fc]
I'll ask my sister about her plans without mentioning Ochi-san's[r]
invitation.[pcms]

*4268|
[fc]
If I try to be considerate and match our plans to hers, it defeats the[r]
purpose of inviting my sister on this trip.[pcms]

*4269|
[fc]
Anyway, I had a feeling that the 18th was going to be a busy day.[pcms]
