[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Hey, take the two of them to the cabin. I think they'll behave,[r]
but... be careful."[pcms]

*534|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member A[nse]
"I know, I know. They're just like the usual guests, right?"[pcms]

*535|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member B[nse]
"If we have to deal with sick people every time, it's not going to[r]
work out for them either."[pcms]

*536|
[fc]
A certain isolated island in the Pacific, cut off from the outside[r]
world, floating in the waters near Japan.[pcms]

*537|
[fc]
From that small island, there was a regular service to the secluded[r]
Oogamijima, not accessible to general passengers.[pcms]

*538|
[fc]
With no tourist attractions and rarely approached even by fishermen,[r]
there were no guests with business on that small island, and the lack[r]
of general passenger use never caused any problems.[pcms]

*539|
[fc]
However... it was certain that the service was reliably in operation.[pcms]

*540|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member A[nse]
"Watch your step, there's a step here, okay?"[pcms]

*541|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member B[nse]
"Did you hear that? Please be careful with that spot on the floor,[r]
guest."[pcms]

*542|
[fc]
The regular ship departing from Oogamijima would unload all cargo on[r]
the small island, from food and daily necessities to personal[r]
belongings and various materials, and then set sail again with two[r]
passengers on board.[pcms]

*543|
[fc]
The two were clad in something resembling white raincoats, with gloves[r]
to boots ensuring no skin was exposed.[pcms]

*544|
[fc]
They wore large hats on their heads and even donned large masks that[r]
covered more than half of their faces.[pcms]

*545|
[fc]
The two crew members stuck close to the side of each guest, vigilant[r]
as if prepared for any eventuality.[pcms]

*546|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"That's the room there, treat them with care."[pcms]

*547|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member A[nse]
"I know, I know. Please come in."[pcms]

*548|
[fc]
The male guest entered the room with unsteady steps, followed by the[r]
female guest who also passed through the door.[pcms]

*549|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member B[nse]
"Whoa... they're quite unsteady on their feet."[pcms]

*550|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member A[nse]
"The guests this time seem to be quite under the weather."[pcms]

*551|
[fc]
[ns]Deck Chief[nse]
"It would be all for nothing if they fell and got injured. Take good[r]
care of them."[pcms]

*552|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member B[nse]
"I know. We'd be at a loss if the sick got injured."[pcms]

*553|
[fc]
The two guests were led to a spartan guest room where they sat down on[r]
chairs, facing each other as if exchanging glances.[pcms]

*554|
[fc]
It was unclear what circumstances brought the two together, but they[r]
didn't seem like complete strangers to each other.[pcms]

*555|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member A[nse]
"It's reassuring that they're this calm."[pcms]

*556|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Yeah... but don't let your guard down."[pcms]

*557|
[fc]
No tourists stop by the small island from which this regular ship[r]
departs.[pcms]

*558|
[fc]
The only thing on the island is a research facility established by the[r]
government; there's nothing else.[pcms]

*559|
[fc]
The deck chief didn't know what kind of distasteful research was being[r]
conducted on such a deserted island and didn't want to know either.[pcms]

*560|
[fc]
It wasn't hard to understand why it was so isolated.[pcms]

*561|
[fc]
It probably meant that they were conducting dangerous research that[r]
wouldn't bother nearby residentsa sort of consideration.[pcms]

*562|
[fc]
But... why was there a rule not to pry into this job at all?[pcms]

*563|
[fc]
In other words, could it be that it would be problematic if someone[r]
did inquire?[pcms]

*564|
[fc]
Research conducted in secret, away from prying eyes... The crew[r]
members all felt nothing but a sense of eeriness.[pcms]

*565|
[fc]
However, their work was no different from any ordinary job.[pcms]

*566|
[fc]
They simply made several round trips a month from Oogamijima to that[r]
particular small island, transporting various supplies.[pcms]

*567|
[fc]
Every three months there seemed to be a change or increase in[r]
personnel; they transported various people, but they were no different[r]
from regular guests.[pcms]

*568|
[fc]
Sometimes they transported people who seemed to have fallen ill on the[r]
island, but it wasn't so irregular.[pcms]

*569|
[fc]
That is, compared to the guests they were currently transporting.[pcms]

*570|
[fc]
The two crew members thought of them as just another case of guests[r]
who had fallen ill, but the deck chief had heard the full story.[pcms]

*571|
[fc]
In terms of being problematic guests, they might be in a league of[r]
their own.[pcms]

*572|
[fc]
But frustratingly, there was no doubt that they were VIPs who turned[r]
into a tremendous amount of money.[pcms]

*573|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"It'll be a big deal if someone jumps into the sea like before, keep a[r]
close eye on them."[pcms]

*574|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member A[nse]
"I know, I know."[pcms]

*575|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"When it's time, take them their meal and have the doctor check on[r]
them."[pcms]

*576|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member B[nse]
"I'm not really good with doctors."[pcms]

*577|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Stop complaining and do your job properly."[pcms]

*578|
[fc]
The deck chief, judging that there were no problems, left the two crew[r]
members in charge and exited the room.[pcms]

About six hours after departing from the small island with the[r]
government research facility. In the still dark and quiet sea, that[r]
scream tore through the darkness.[pcms]

;//bgm13.ogg
[bgm storage="BGM13"]

*580|
[fc]
Tension ran through everyone, whether they were taking a nap, working,[r]
or just idling around.[pcms]

*581|
[fc]
The sound came from the direction of the guest rooms. There should be[r]
two crew members and guests there...[pcms]

Everyone not needed for steering the ship gathered at the guest rooms[r]
to check on the disturbance.[pcms]

[se buf=0 storage="seA023"]

*583|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"What happened! What's going on!"[pcms]

*584|
[fc]
In front of the guest room, the ship's doctor and two veteran crew[r]
members had gathered, just as they were about to open the door and[r]
check inside.[pcms]

*585|
[fc]
Upon seeing the deck chief, one of the veteran crew members opened the[r]
guest room door with resolve.[pcms]

*586|
[fc]
The voice wasn't like someone who had sleepily fallen out of bed. It[r]
was clearly a death agony... or something similar to a scream.[pcms]

*587|
[fc]
When the veteran crew member opened the door, a thick smell of blood[r]
wafted out from the room.[pcms]

*588|
[fc]
With just a little bleeding, one wouldn't feel the warmth and smell of[r]
blood like this.[pcms]

*589|
[fc]
And what assaulted their senses next was... the sight of a guest room[r]
dyed completely red and transformed beyond recognition.[pcms]

*590|
[fc]
Blood was splattered all over the walls, and from the bed to chairs to[r]
desks, blood dripped down everywhere.[pcms]

"Ka...kahh..."[pcms]

*592|
[fc]
One of the crew members assigned to take care of the guests looked at[r]
the people who had rushed into the room with eyes begging for help.[pcms]

*593|
[fc]
The male guest was clinging to a crew member, biting at his neck as if[r]
trying to sink his teeth in.[pcms]

*594|
[fc]
Like water bursting from a torn hose, red fake blood was splattered[r]
all over the room.[pcms]

*595|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Pull him off!"[pcms]

*596|
[fc]
No explanation was needed for who or what; the two veteran crew[r]
members understood the order.[pcms]

*597|
[fc]
One held the guest from behind in a full nelson to pull him up and[r]
away from his colleague.[pcms]

*598|
[fc]
The other supported the crew member's body while kicking at the[r]
guest's stomach to try and rescue him.[pcms]

[fc]
Blood splashed over everyone present at the scene.[pcms]

*600|
[fc]
But there was no time to worry about such things.[pcms]

*601|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Ship's doctor! Give that guest some medicine!"[pcms]

*602|
[fc]
[ns]Ship's Doctor[nse]
"Y-yes... this is the one I heard about."[pcms]

*603|
[fc]
The ship's doctor, as if anticipating this situation, began preparing[r]
an injection with trembling hands.[pcms]

*604|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member C[nse]
"Hey, stop struggling!"[pcms]

*605|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member D[nse]
"Hey, are you okay? Hang in there!"[pcms]

*606|
[fc]
The guest, who had been staggering around like a half-sick person, was[r]
now trying to break free from the strong grip of a veteran sailor.[pcms]

*607|
[fc]
[ns]Male Customer[nse]
"My stomach... hurts... nggh..."[pcms]

*608|
[fc]
The crew members shuddered at the drunken-sounding words of the male[r]
guest.[pcms]

*609|
[fc]
They didn't actually know, but in their minds, they could guess what[r]
this was all about based on their knowledge.[pcms]

*610|
[fc]
An incident that turned humans into something like this had occurred[r]
in Tohoku...[pcms]

*611|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member D[nse]
"Deck chief... this is..."[pcms]

*612|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Ugh..."[pcms]

*613|
[fc]
The veteran sailor looked on... the neck of the injured crew member[r]
was covered with something like ivory tusks embedded densely.[pcms]

*614|
[fc]
When the deck chief looked at the male guest, he realized that his[r]
unpleasant imagination was indeed reality.[pcms]

*615|
[fc]
In the mouth of the male guest... there were no teeth left.[pcms]

*616|
[fc]
It must have been the result of two strong men forcibly pulling away[r]
his body after he bit down with tremendous force, leaving teeth[r]
embedded in the crew member's neck.[pcms]

*617|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Ship's doctor! Is it ready yet?!"[pcms]

*618|
[fc]
In the room filled with the stench of fresh blood, the ship's doctor[r]
was injecting the raging male guest.[pcms]

*619|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Take the injured to the infirmary, hurry!"[pcms]

*620|
[fc]
[ns]Crew Member D[nse]
"But... however..."[pcms]

*621|
[fc]
What could possibly be done for a human who had bled out to such an[r]
extent?[pcms]

*622|
[fc]
It was highly likely that they were already dead from shock.[pcms]

*623|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Just carry them out!"[pcms]

*624|
[fc]
The crew member, embracing his colleague from behind, dragged the body[r]
to the infirmary.[pcms]

*625|
[fc]
As if it were some kind of game, a red line was drawn along their[r]
path.[pcms]

*626|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"How's it looking over there?"[pcms]

*627|
[fc]
[ns]Ship's Doctor[nse]
"I'm not sure... his movements have slowed down..."[pcms]

*628|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Just leave him there."[pcms]

;//seB014.ogg
[se buf=0 storage="seB014"]

*629|
[fc]
After giving such an order to the veteran sailor, the male guest was[r]
thrown onto the bed.[pcms]

*630|
[fc]
He might be incredibly strong, but his body weight was quite light.[pcms]

*631|
[fc]
Looking at where the male guest was thrown, remnants of what seemed to[r]
be lunch were scattered around, and next to it, another crew member[r]
lay dead.[pcms]

*632|
[fc]
Although covered in blood, there were no significant injuries visible[r]
on his upper body.[pcms]

*633|
[fc]
The deck chief shifted his gaze and saw that the dead crew member was[r]
bleeding from around the crotch... and his genitals had been gouged[r]
out.[pcms]

*634|
[fc]
He frowned at the painful sight, feeling a chill.[pcms]

*635|
[fc]
It was a sight that would make any man feel revulsion.[pcms]

*636|
[fc]
Then, the deck chief found a female guest crouching in a corner of the[r]
room wearing a raincoat.[pcms]

*637|
[fc]
Her face was not visible under the brim of her hat, soaked with blood[r]
on her raincoat, but she probably didn't need protection.[pcms]

*638|
[fc]
She must be just like the male guest, a badger from the same hole.[r]
They were companions after all.[pcms]

*639|
[fc]
The deck chief felt a sense of discomfort at her figure as he was[r]
about to leave the room and tilted his head.[pcms]

*640|
[fc]
The female guest wasn't supposed to be wearing lipstick, but her lips[r]
were unnaturally red.[pcms]

*641|
[fc]
However, seeing a red streak like a drip spilling from those lips, the[r]
deck chief understood that it wasn't lipstick.[pcms]

*642|
[fc]
It was the blood of a crew member who had been subordinate to him.[pcms]

*643|
[fc]
Moreover, the way it was wet didn't look like splattered blood; it was[r]
blood that had gotten there when she bit someone, just like the male[r]
guest had done.[pcms]

*644|
[fc]
However, the place where the dead crew member was injured...[pcms]

*645|
[fc]
The female guest looked up at the deck chief from under the brim of[r]
her hat as if tilting her head.[pcms]

*646|
[fc]
Then, with her lips stained red with blood, she let out a sinister[r]
smile.[pcms]

[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Captain, we have a serious situation."[pcms]

*648|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"This has become troublesome... but everyone has been vaccinated,[r]
right?"[pcms]

*649|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Yes, there are no issues on that front."[pcms]

*650|
[fc]
Even though they had just recovered from chaos, two people had died in[r]
a country governed by law.[pcms]

*651|
[fc]
If word got out to the families and the police started moving, it[r]
might become impossible to cover up.[pcms]

*652|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"How is the one taken to the infirmary?"[pcms]

*653|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"She's dead. The infirmary is a sea of blood now..."[pcms]

*654|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]

*655|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"They're quite shaken, but for now, we've got them taking showers...[r]
*cough*"[pcms]

*656|
[fc]
The deck chief cleared his throat to compose himself and then lowered[r]
his voice to await the captain's orders.[pcms]

*657|
[fc]
What to do with the two dead bodies... It was hard to believe they[r]
would simply hand them over to the police.[pcms]

*658|
[fc]
But what to do... Throw them into the sea?[pcms]

*659|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"We could say it was an accidental fall and dispose of the bodies at[r]
sea... Or maybe we could get the islanders to take care of them."[pcms]

*660|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"Are you sure that's okay...?"[pcms]

*661|
[fc]
The deck chief couldn't shake off a bad feeling about this.[pcms]

*662|
[fc]
They were lured by a large reward despite the risks, so he thought it[r]
would be better to handle their own affairs themselves.[pcms]

*663|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"I'm joking. If they find out there was a mistake, our reward might be[r]
reduced. Just process the two as accidental falls."[pcms]

*664|
[fc]
[ns]Boatswain[nse]
"I'll give the others some money to keep their mouths shut."[pcms]

*665|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"Yes, and then there's the guests and their rooms... and the[r]
infirmary. They need to be thoroughly cleaned."[pcms]

*666|
[fc]
We'll arrive at Oogami Island by late tonight.[pcms]

*667|
[fc]
There was a mountain of things that needed to be done before then for[r]
the two of them.[pcms]

*667a|
[fc]
The rules on land and at sea are different...[pcms]

*668|
[fc]
Not that they were thinking about such things, but there seemed to be[r]
no intention whatsoever of turning the guests over to the police.[pcms]

*670|
[fc]
The ship that arrived at the port had to unload empty containers and[r]
load the next cargo.[pcms]

*671|
[fc]
Knowing that they would get a break after this was done, the crew[r]
members whipped their tired bodies into action for one last job.[pcms]

*672|
[fc]
It was unclear what kind of rumors were circulating inside the ship,[r]
but no particular agitation could be seen among the crew members.[pcms]

*673|
[fc]
They were going about their usual work in a matter-of-fact manner,[r]
which deeply satisfied the captain.[pcms]

*674|
[fc]
They would have to consider replenishing the crew, but for the time[r]
being, they would have to make do with this number of people.[pcms]

*675|
[fc]
It was distressing not to be able to explain the situation, but[r]
subordinates who showed no strange fear or confusion were reassuring.[pcms]

*676|

The captain, descending from the gangway, was greeted by men with a[r]
shady aura.[pcms]

Clearly not upstanding citizens, but they didn't seem like petty[r]
yakuza from the countryside either.[pcms]

The dangerous aura they exuded made it clear that this was no game.[pcms]

*678|
[fc]
In this midsummer heat, wearing heavy coats and obviously hiding[r]
something underneath didn't require scrutiny.[pcms]

*679|
[fc]
The captain looked back and saw a guest being brought by four crew[r]
members before meeting eyes with the boss of the men.[pcms]

*680|
[fc]
He was indeed the man called Oz.[pcms]

*681|
[fc]
Oz also seemed uninterested in unnecessary exchanges and silently took[r]
custody of the guest after signaling his subordinate.[pcms]

The subordinates then led the two guests away into the depths of the[r]
port facilities.[pcms]

nearby.[pcms]

*687|
[fc]
There was the deck chief, awkwardly being helped up, and the ship's[r]
doctor offering a hand.[pcms]

*688|
[fc]
It's known that slipping is easy, but falling on a ship can be deadly.[r]
The captain decided to forget what seemed like an uncharacteristic[r]
sight.[pcms]

*689|
[fc]
[ns]Oz[nse]
"No problems? Well, we'll see about that."[pcms]

*690|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"Anyone can slip and fall."[pcms]

*691|
[fc]
[ns]Ship's Doctor[nse]
"Then, Captain, I'll be excusing myself first... Cough, cough."[pcms]

*692|
[fc]
[ns]Captain[nse]
"What's the matter? A doctor catching a cold?"[pcms]

*693|
[fc]
[ns]Ship's Doctor[nse]
"Just like anyone can slip, a doctor can catch a cold too."[pcms]

*694|
[fc]
The captain confirmed that the deck chief and ship's doctor had left,[r]
then approached the other party.[pcms]

*695|
[fc]
The cargo had been handed over. Now it was time for the payment.[pcms]

*696|
[fc]
Reading the meaning in the captain's gaze, Oz slightly narrowed his[r]
eyes and jerked his chin towards the port facilities behind him.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oz1_su"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_oz02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*697|
[fc]
[ns]Oz[nse]
"Go to the top floor. We'll settle it with a handover."[pcms]

*698|
[fc]
The captain glanced at Oz and passed by him without a word.[pcms]

*699|
[fc]
Once their business was concluded, there was no need for further[r]
words. Oz lit a cigarette and let his thoughts drift with the purple[r]
smoke.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oz1_su"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_oz01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*700|
[fc]
[ns]Oz[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*701|
[fc]
Even as he thought that their relationship would end once the money[r]
was paid, Oz found himself contemplating the captain.[pcms]

*702|
[fc]
It was a job that would have been a bit too much for an honest person[r]
to handle.[pcms]

*703|
[fc]
What one is willing to do for money varies from person to person, but[r]
this job was special.[pcms]

*704|
[fc]
It was different from just transporting cargo to a laboratory; the[r]
level of danger was different. At worst, they could have been erased.[pcms]

*705|
[fc]
But as he thought that far, Oz twisted his lips in self-derision. What[r]
about himself?[pcms]

*706|
[fc]
If someone were to be cut off, he would be no different. Yet here he[r]
was, risking danger for money.[pcms]

*707|
[fc]
Of course, he was confident in his ability to avoid such an outcome,[r]
but perhaps the captain felt the same way.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oz2_su"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_oz01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*708|
[fc]
[ns]Oz[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*709|
[fc]
Thinking it unlike him to ponder such idle thoughts, he unusually[r]
tightened up his relaxed spirit.[pcms]

*710|
[fc]
The job wasn't finished yet.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*711|
[fc]
Oz threw his cigarette into the night sea and left the place.[pcms]
