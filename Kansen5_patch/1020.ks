After waking up the sleepy Souichirou and explaining the situation, we[r]
smoothly moved from Arai's room to Ochi-san's room.[pcms]

Arai's room was still empty as his roommate hadn't returned, and it[r]
was the same for Ochi-san's room; her roommate was nowhere to be seen.[pcms]

*562|
[fc]
Given the situation, it's safe to assume that a significant number of[r]
people are infected. If you thought something was off and went out[r]
into the hallway without any information, you'd encounter them and be[r]
out of luck.[pcms]

*563|
[fc]
While Ochi-san was packing her belongings, Souichirou seemed to be[r]
making a phone call in the lobby.[pcms]

*564|
[fc]
We have to inform the hotel about this situation. I'm doubtful about[r]
how much of their operational functions are still intact though...[pcms]

The number of my sister's room was... certainly... it's a lower[r]

Retracing the hallway we had come through, this time with my sister,[r]
there was a different sense of security than when I was with everyone[r]
else.[pcms]

Some of the infected were facing towards the staircase, and others[r]
were facing towards the direction of my sister's room that I had run[r]
to.[pcms]

With some of them having their backs turned, it was somewhat easier[r]
than the first time I ran through.[pcms]

My sister didn't do anything unnecessary and rushed straight into the[r]
