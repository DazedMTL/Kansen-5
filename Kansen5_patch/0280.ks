On the first day of the training camp, each club was practicing[r]
seriously, showing no signs of fatigue from the journey.[pcms]

*3747|
[fc]
In the case of other schools, they would just take a bath and then go[r]
to sleep, but Uguisudani Academy checks into a hotel.[pcms]

*3748|
[fc]
Even after a tiring practice, we have to push ourselves to return to[r]
the hotel.[pcms]

*3749|
[fc]
The last bus leaving the sports center at 19:40 was filled with faces[r]
exhausted to the core.[pcms]

*3750|
[fc]
I suppose this scene will continue for the days to come.[pcms]

*3751|
[fc]
Looking at the members half-asleep, I could almost feel the intensity[r]
of the day's practice.[pcms]

*3752|
[fc]
Being the first day, there were various issues, but by now everyone[r]
must be in their dreams.[pcms]

*3753|
[fc]
Except for the newspaper club, that is.[pcms]

*3754|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"It's finally over~!"[pcms]

*3755|
[fc]
I pressed the Enter key on my laptop provided by the newspaper club[r]
and leaned back in my chair.[pcms]

*3756|
[fc]
I need to send the daily report and the text data I gathered from[r]
interviews to my senior Frank for review.[pcms]

*3757|
[fc]
While everyone else is enjoying their after-practice time, this is the[r]
real deal for us in the newspaper club.[pcms]

*3758|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Nnngh!"[pcms]

*3759|
[fc]
After a big stretch, I couldn't help but check the time. It seems[r]
today isn't over just yet.[pcms]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Good work. I can't spare a hand right now, but have some cold tea."[pcms]

*3761|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Thanks, honestly, it's a lifesaver."[pcms]

*3762|
[fc]
Debu-kun has already changed into something more comfortable and is[r]
completely relaxed, pouring grape juice into a wine glass.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="so1_si_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_so03a"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=340 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3763|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"No worries, we help each other out in times of need... ah!"[pcms]

*3764|
[fc]
Souichirou, who had long finished his own work, had already joined up[r]
with Satto™ and was putting his energy into Monster Busters.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*3765|
[fc]
I took a sip of my drink and let out a sigh while waiting for a reply[r]
from senior Frank.[pcms]

*3766|
[fc]
If I can condense the key points from today's interview notes into[r]
text and forward that information to the chief in Tokyo, my work for[r]
today will be done.[pcms]

*3767|
[fc]
I had so much I wanted to write about that it turned out to be more of[r]
a struggle than I thought.[pcms]

*3768|
[fc]
If it weren't for Souichirou's editing, I might not have finished yet.[pcms]

*3769|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Thank goodness it ended without dragging into another day. It's all[r]
thanks to Souichirou."[pcms]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"It was an easy task... but you seem to have a high opinion of[r]
Hanazawa. Honestly, I'm surprised."[pcms]

*3771|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"I have no intention of letting personal matters influence my[r]
articles. Hanazawa's hard work and sense deserve recognition."[pcms]

*3772|
[fc]
Writing spiteful comments just for the sake of it would only cast[r]
doubt on my character.[pcms]

*3773|
[fc]
The way it's written matters, but I have no intention of disparaging[r]
anyone with a biased view.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="so1_si_b"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_so28b"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=340 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3774|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"I'm glad we became friends."[pcms]

*3775|
[fc]
Souichirou tilted his wine glass towards me as if he had been waiting[r]
for this moment.[pcms]

*3776|
[fc]
A best friend who can approach both games and work with composure is[r]
truly reliable.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*3777|
[fc]
As I was thinking this, an email notification appeared on my laptop[r]
screen.[pcms]

*3778|
[fc]
When I opened it, it was the much-awaited 'good work' email from[r]
senior Frank.[pcms]

*3779|
[fc]
He must have stayed up until this time waiting for me. He really is a[r]
good person through and through.[pcms]

*3780|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"I got a 'good work' email from senior Frank. Thank you for your hard[r]
work."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="so1_si_b"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_so04w"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=340 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3781|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Sorry to rush you, but Murakami-san has come to the Monster Busters[r]
camp, so come join us."[pcms]

*3782|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Alright, I've got to talk about today's events too."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*3783|
[fc]
Honestly, meeting Tarja-san is exhausting, but it's unavoidable.[pcms]

*3784|
[fc]
I took out my portable game console from my bag and put on my headset.[pcms]

*3785|
[fc]
As if he had been waiting for that, Souichirou also put on his[r]
headset.[pcms]

*3786|
[fc]
It seems he was refraining from voice chat until my work was done.[pcms]

*3787|
[fc]
When I connected my portable game console through Souichirou's laptop,[r]
I logged straight into Monster Busters.[pcms]

[ns]Satto™[nse]
"Good work, it seems like it was tough."[pcms]

*3789|
[fc]
As soon as I logged into Monster Busters, Satto™ greeted me.[pcms]

*3790|
[fc]
Now that we know each other in real life, I can't help but picture[r]
Murakami-san when I hear her voice.[pcms]

*3791|
[fc]
She's a typical island girl and quite cute, I recall. It makes me[r]
happy.[pcms]

*3792|
[fc]
[ns]Ma-Kun.S[nse]
"Good work~ Satto™, you sound energetic even after practice."[pcms]

*3793|
[fc]
[vo_sat s="sato_chat0042"]
[ns]Satto™[nse]
"I'm tired, but it's too early to sleep~ Besides, you're Nakazawa-kun,[r]
right?"[pcms]

*3794|
[fc]
[ns]Ma-Kun.S[nse]
"Ah, yeah... that's right."[pcms]

*3795|
[fc]
We're not role-playing or anything, so it's fine to be called by my[r]
real name... but it still makes my heart race.[pcms]

[ns]Satto™[nse]
"You have a cute face but you're pretty good, aren't you~?"[pcms]

*3797|
[fc]
With a chuckle that sounded like an old man's laugh, she started[r]
saying things that caught my attention.[pcms]

*3798|
[fc]
Cute face aside, what does she mean by 'pretty good'?[pcms]

*3799|
[fc]
I wonder if I've done something to catch Satto™'s attention as well?[pcms]

*3800|
[fc]
[vo_sat s="sato_chat0044"]
[ns]Satto™[nse]
"The cute girl who came to call you at the sports center, she's from[r]
the Ochi mansion, right? You've hit the jackpot!"[pcms]

*3801|
[fc]
So that's what it was about. Souichirou must have been spreading some[r]
unnecessary rumors.[pcms]

*3802|
[fc]
There's no way Murakami-san would know about Ochi-san, let alone[r]
understand their relationshipit's even more unclear.[pcms]

I kicked Pig-kun in the shin area at the opposite table. A strange[r]
voice came through the voice chat.[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Ma-Kun.S[nse]
"It's nothing, but there's a misunderstanding about Ochi-san. I don't[r]

relationship yet."[pcms]

for both of us."[pcms]

[ns]Satto™[nse]
"I think I just saw the real Fatty.G for the first time."[pcms]

*3810|
[fc]
In both the net and real life, he always plays a character. That must[r]
mean he's serious about Ochi-san.[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Ma-Kun.S[nse]
"Unfortunately, she's not my girlfriend."[pcms]

misunderstanding about Ochi-san."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Ma-Kun.S[nse]
"Ngh, that's hot!"[pcms]

*3814|

Souichirou kicked me in the shin as if returning the favor. Both of us[r]
might end up with bruises by tomorrow.[pcms]

*3815|
[fc]
[ns]Fatty.G[nse]
"Well, if we're talking about who's suitable, of course it would be[r]
me. Hehe."[pcms]

*3816|
[fc]
I wondered what he was going to say all of a sudden; it seemed like he[r]
had lost his mind.[pcms]

*3817|
[fc]
He chases after Ochi-san calling her a princess and acts like a[r]
stalker; there's no way he's suitable.[pcms]

Souichirou is thrashing about on his chair. Even his character on the[r]

Souichirou silently delivered a kick to my shin. I hadn't even said[r]

I knew they were quite wealthy and had a princess-like family lineage,[r]
but they really are local celebrities.[pcms]

If we were in the same class, would it be too presumptuous to approach[r]
her? Would she keep her distance?[pcms]

Absolute power holders... Is it really that significant? It seems like[r]
it's more than just being wealthy.[pcms]

"I was taught by adults when I was little. The Omi Shrine on the[r]
island is said to have been established by Ochi family ancestors."[pcms]

I wonder if there's something special about that shrine. That seems to[r]

[fc]
[vo_sat s="sato_chat0058"]

"The whole group is impressive, but especially the head of the family[r]

extraordinary."[pcms]

*3846|
[fc]
So they hold both money and power. Ochi-san was born into an[r]
incredible family.[pcms]

Living around here seems simple but probably comes with its fair share[r]
of complications.[pcms]

[ns]Fatty.G[nse]
"If you're in the tourism business, you'd want events like that."[pcms]

I'm reminded of that person named Kazuo Ochi, Ochi-san's uncle.[pcms]

*3851|
[fc]
Someone as shrewd as him would probably find organizing such events[r]
trivial.[pcms]

*3852|
[fc]
Even though you can travel between Honshu and Shikoku via the bridge,[r]
this island isn't that accessible.[pcms]

Being able to attract such a big event really shows their power.[pcms]

It's August now, so it seems they had quite a delay with the[r]
construction. Was there some issue with this floor alone?[pcms]

*3857|
[fc]
[ns]Fatty.G[nse]
"It seems like this hotel's opening was also part of the attraction[r]

*3858|
[fc]
Indeed, many students at Uguisudani Academy come from wealthy families[r]
or those involved in media.[pcms]

*3859|
[fc]
In fact, Souichirou is the son of a magazine editor; if all that was[r]

It would have been a chance to apologize if she had complained, but[r]
her being quiet might mean she's really angry.[pcms]

*3872|
[fc]
It doesn't seem like she's told Murakami-san either, this might be[r]
seriously bad.[pcms]

I was confessing that I had inadvertently taken out my camera because[r]
Taryan-san was so beautiful.[pcms]

*3876|
[fc]
I wanted to talk about it to feel better, but I also needed to explain[r]
the situation to avoid any weird vibes.[pcms]

*3877|

Anyway, suddenly taking out a camera was not okay. I need to reflect[r]
on that.[pcms]

With that appearance and personality, she must have had her fair share[r]

She probably got teased as a child too...[pcms]

If she's straightforward... then if she dislikes something, she shows[r]
it.[pcms]

If she's like that in the game, I'd think she's the same in real life.[pcms]

Once you've built a wall, it's not easy to tear it down yourself.[pcms]

Making a good impression is important when starting a new life, but it[r]

It might be a conversation I shouldn't be having, but it's rare for[r]
someone to have issues and not be able to get along with others.[pcms]

If there's anything I can do to help, I would like to do so...[pcms]

"Somehow, her parents decided on their own to move here, but Taryan[r]
didn't want to leave Kyoto."[pcms]

Maybe it's resistance to the move. By not getting used to the place,[r]
she might be trying to make a point to her parents.[pcms]

With a rather serious groan, Murakami-san seemed to be hesitating[r]
about something.[pcms]

It's probably not good to pry too much.[pcms]

that.[pcms]
