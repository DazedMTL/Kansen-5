Upon reaching the first floor landing, I peek through a slightly[r]
opened door to check the situation in the lobby.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*728|
[fc]
At a glance, there are quite a number of infected walking around, but[r]
the situation is especially bad near the front entrance.[pcms]

*729|
[fc]
Given the circumstances, it's possible that not only hotel guests and[r]
employees are infected, but also that infected people from outside[r]
have entered.[pcms]

As I quietly close the door, Souichirou, who was peeking with me,[r]
pulls his head back.[pcms]

"This is bad. With that situation, we can't even get to the entrance[r]

[ns]Arai[nse]
"We've tried several times already, but their movements are sluggish,[r]
right? I think we can dodge them easily enough."[pcms]

*733|

As Arai says this, Souichirou rolls up his sleeve to show the bruise[r]
on his hand that has turned blue-purple.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="so1_se_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_so06a"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=340 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"This is just from being grabbed by Hanazawa. Isn't it dangerous to[r]
rush in without a plan against such brute strength? Once caught, it's[r]
doubtful we could escape."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=4 chbase="ak1_se2"][ChrSetParts layer=4 chface="F1_ak10"][ChrSetXY layer=4 x=600 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Well, it's like a kiss mark."[pcms]

He says that as if he's had one before... always talking like that.[pcms]

*738|

[ns]Arai[nse]
"Idiot, that's not the point."[pcms]

*739|
[fc]
Arai looks at Souichirou with a bit of disgust. Being grabbed over[r]
clothes shouldn't transmit the infection... or so we hope.[pcms]

"There's no bleeding, so it should be fine. Their virus is transmitted[r]
through bodily fluids."[pcms]

*741|
[fc]
Still, being grabbed with bare hands is dangerous. We don't know what[r]
could happen with sebum or sweat, but it was fortunate he was grabbed[r]
over his clothes.[pcms]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Anyway, brute force is not in our favor. Let's try to make contact[r]
with the other side."[pcms]

*745|
[fc]
Souichirou takes out his smartphone, wipes the grease off the screen[r]
with his shirt, and starts making a call.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*746|
[fc]
It seems he's having trouble getting through; he redials several times[r]
but finally seems to have connected and is waiting for the recipient[r]
to answer.[pcms]

*747|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Ah, Frank-senpai. We've made it to the first floor but... eh? There's[r]
a dispute?"[pcms]

*748|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu0144"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*749|
[fc]
I wonder what's happening inside. Souichirou seems a bit flustered.[pcms]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Hello? What do you mean by a dispute...? Hey? Senpai? Hello!?"[pcms]

It seems the call has been cut off. Souichirou tries to redial but[r]
can't get through.[pcms]

*752|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"What happened?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="so1_se_b"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_so06b"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=340 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]

[ns]Arai[nse]

*756|
[fc]
It's natural for a group of strangers to not immediately form a united[r]
front.[pcms]

*757|
[fc]
There are those who want to help if someone is in need and those who[r]
don't want to take risks as long as they are safe. It was only natural[r]
for both types to exist.[pcms]

*758|
[fc]
Onee-san opens the door and checks the situation in the lobby. After[r]
thinking for a bit, she closes the door again.[pcms]

As time passes, the number of infected will likely increase. If that[r]
happens, staying here will become dangerous.[pcms]

Souichirou keeps trying to call, but there's no sign of getting[r]
through.[pcms]

We're betting on the humanity of the people inside, but we can't think[r]
of any other method.[pcms]

Looking around for something to use, I spot an axe and a fire[r]
