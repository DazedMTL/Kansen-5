Upon reaching the first floor landing, I peek through a slightly[r]
opened door to check the situation in the lobby.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*728|
[fc]
At a glance, there are quite a number of infected walking around, but[r]
the situation is especially bad near the front entrance.[pcms]

*729|
[fc]
Given the circumstances, it's possible that not only hotel guests and[r]
employees are infected, but also that infected people from outside[r]
have entered.[pcms]

As I quietly close the door, Souichirou, who was peeking with me,[r]
pulls his head back.[pcms]

"We've tried several times already, but their movements are sluggish,[r]

As Arai says this, Souichirou rolls up his sleeve to show the bruise[r]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"This is just from being grabbed by Hanazawa. Isn't it dangerous to[r]
rush in without a plan against such brute strength? Once caught, it's[r]
doubtful we could escape."[pcms]

He says that as if he's had one before... always talking like that.[pcms]

[ns]Arai[nse]
"Idiot, that's not the point."[pcms]

*739|
[fc]
Arai looks at Souichirou with a bit of disgust. Being grabbed over[r]
clothes shouldn't transmit the infection... or so we hope.[pcms]

"There's no bleeding, so it should be fine. Their virus is transmitted[r]

Still, being grabbed with bare hands is dangerous. We don't know what[r]
could happen with sebum or sweat, but it was fortunate he was grabbed[r]
over his clothes.[pcms]

Souichirou takes out his smartphone, wipes the grease off the screen[r]
with his shirt, and starts making a call.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*746|
[fc]
It seems he's having trouble getting through; he redials several times[r]

"Ah, Frank-senpai. We've made it to the first floor but... eh? There's[r]
a dispute?"[pcms]

*749|

I wonder what's happening inside. Souichirou seems a bit flustered.[pcms]

"Hello? What do you mean by a dispute...? Hey? Senpai? Hello!?"[pcms]

It seems the call has been cut off. Souichirou tries to redial but[r]
can't get through.[pcms]

*756|
[fc]
It's natural for a group of strangers to not immediately form a united[r]
front.[pcms]

*757|
[fc]
There are those who want to help if someone is in need and those who[r]
don't want to take risks as long as they are safe. It was only natural[r]
for both types to exist.[pcms]

*758|

Onee-san opens the door and checks the situation in the lobby. After[r]
thinking for a bit, she closes the door again.[pcms]

As time passes, the number of infected will likely increase. If that[r]
happens, staying here will become dangerous.[pcms]

Souichirou keeps trying to call, but there's no sign of getting[r]
through.[pcms]

We're betting on the humanity of the people inside, but we can't think[r]
of any other method.[pcms]
