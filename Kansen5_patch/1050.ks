"It's okay, there are hardly any infected on this side."[pcms]

While slowly raising the shutter, Souichirou peeked outside and gave[r]
the OK sign.[pcms]

as usual.[pcms]

"What is this...?"[pcms]

*1097|
[fc]
Mr. Kazuo handed Ms. Ochi something that looked like a rod covered in[r]
cloth. It was quite long and at first glance, it was unclear what it[r]
was.[pcms]

*1098|
[fc]
Ms. Ochi untied the string that was tying the cloth and took out the[r]
item inside.[pcms]

*1099|

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"It's something I received from an influential person living on the[r]
neighboring Oomi Island. It will be more useful than just decorating[r]
my room."[pcms]

[ns]Akari[nse]
"Is this real...?"[pcms]

*1101|
[fc]
It was a real naginata, with a blade so shiny that its reflection was[r]
dazzling.[pcms]

*1102|
[fc]
If one intended to, it could certainly harm a person, a genuine lethal[r]
weapon.[pcms]

*1103|
[fc]
[ns]Arai[nse]
"Ugh..."[pcms]

*1104|
[fc]
Seeing the blade in Ms. Ochi's hands, it was clear that Arai's heart[r]
was already in turmoil.[pcms]

*1105|
[fc]
The excitement he once felt towards me had faded, and his imagination[r]
was beginning to catch up with the hardships we were about to face.[pcms]

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"Come on, get in. It's dangerous to keep the shutter open for too[r]
long."[pcms]

*1107|
[fc]
It seemed Mr. Kazuo would take on the role of driver. There was no[r]
trouble here, perhaps an arrangement had been made with the men in[r]
black suits.[pcms]

*1108|
[fc]
When Ms. Ochi got into the passenger seat, the three men boarded the[r]
back seats. Perhaps they were being considerate to avoid any[r]
accidental infection...[pcms]

As I was thinking about such things, the limousine hit someone with a[r]
heavy impact and sent them flying.[pcms]

It was impossible to avoid all the infected wandering the narrow roads[r]

impossible for a limousine to break through.[pcms]
