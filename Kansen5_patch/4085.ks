After Makoto left, I spent some time on the bed, savoring the[r]
happiness and feeling content.[pcms]

But it's getting to be the time when I really need to start getting[r]

Thinking about when I get into the mosh pit at live shows, I decided[r]
on a halterneck leotard.[pcms]

*1369|
[fc]
With this, there's no chance my top will come off due to the momentum[r]
of the mosh. On top of that, I put on a denim miniskirt and tightened[r]

I was unsure about my hairstyle. I thought about tying it up like[r]

*1372|
[fc]
Is my outfit... a bit too slutty?[pcms]

*1373|
[fc]
It's cheap and easy to move in, and aside from the design, I quite[r]
like it, but maybe Makoto prefers something a bit more ladylike.[pcms]

*1374|
[fc]
Ah, but well, the advice from the gal at my part-time job was right,[r]
after all.[pcms]

*1375|
[fc]
Men are drawn to this kind of outfit... Was that how she put it? I was[r]
thinking it might be true... I'll have to thank her when I get back.[pcms]

*1376|
[fc]
Drawn to... yeah. Last night, Makoto really went on the offensive as a[r]

My pussy twinges slightly. Makoto's afterglow is still lingering in my[r]

The bed is a mess... The sheets have been wet and dried. It feels like[r]
the scent of Makoto and me is rising from there.[pcms]

"..."[pcms]

*1381|
[fc]
I was honestly happy when he said he wanted to embrace me as a woman.[pcms]

*1382|
[fc]
But I felt like I had forced Makoto to make a decision that changed[r]
our relationship up until now.[pcms]

*1383|
[fc]
Until a little while ago, I thought it would be fine if we just[r]
exchanged familial love as a pseudo-family.[pcms]

*1384|
[fc]
In fact, that was more comfortable for me. I've always been bad at[r]
romance.[pcms]

*1385|
[fc]
It's not that I've never had romantic experiences, but the more I got[r]
into such relationships, the less I knew how to behave.[pcms]

*1386|
[fc]
I would inadvertently become curt and ended up falling out with people[r]
who were friends before we started dating.[pcms]

*1387|
[fc]
Since then, I've been careful not to let things turn into romance as[r]
much as possible.[pcms]

*1388|
[fc]
But... Makoto broke through that.[pcms]

*1389|
[fc]
I wasn't much for masturbation, but Makoto increasingly became the[r]
subject of my fantasies.[pcms]

*1390|
[fc]
However, I didn't have the courage to initiate a romantic relationship[r]
with Makoto or make that decision myself.[pcms]

*1391|
[fc]
If he rejected me... I might lose even our pseudo-family relationship.[r]
To me, Makoto had become my one and only family.[pcms]

*1392|
[fc]
So I was afraid of losing him, and that's why I hesitated.[pcms]

*1393|
[fc]
I never really thought that men had to be the ones to initiate[r]
romance.[pcms]

*1394|
[fc]
But I admit that by wearing clothes that "men are drawn to," as the[r]
gals said, I was provoking Makoto.[pcms]

*1395|
[fc]
I was hoping that Makoto would make the decision for us.[pcms]

*1396|
[fc]
It was an important decision, yet I completely left it up to Makoto.[r]
And on top of that... by stimulating his sexual desire...[pcms]

[fc]
But still, when Makoto said we "became man and woman" and "a real[r]

*1399|
[fc]
Honestly, since I provoked him, I was somewhat prepared for what might[r]
come.[pcms]

*1400|
[fc]
"I couldn't hold back and came. But you're not a romantic interest,[r]
Onee-san."[pcms]

I thought it would be okay if he said that. So Makoto's words brought[r]
me unexpected joy.[pcms]

*1443|
[fc]
Four years ago, I was stationed at a Self-Defense Force base near[r]
Honjo City in Akita Prefecture, the epicenter of the epidemic.[pcms]

*1444|
[fc]
I was assigned under Sergeant Major Nakazawa, Makoto's father,[r]
spending my days in training for emergencies.[pcms]

*1445|
[fc]
I never knew my own father. I didn't even know who or where he was. In[r]
Sergeant Major Nakazawa, I saw the figure of a father.[pcms]

*1446|
[fc]
I often thought to myself, "If only he could be my father..."[pcms]

*1447|
[fc]
When on duty, he was a very strict superior officer. But he was also a[r]
reliable person who sincerely faced his subordinates' concerns,[r]
encouraged them, and thought together with them.[pcms]

*1448|
[fc]
That daythe day the epidemic broke outthe base also functioned as an[r]
evacuation site.[pcms]

*1449|
[fc]
We were supposed to be on strict guard to prevent infected individuals[r]
from entering.[pcms]

*1450|
[fc]
Butthere was an outbreak of infection inside the base.[pcms]

*1451|
[fc]
Whether it was someone who had fled there or one of our comrades who[r]
had returned from deployment, it's impossible to determine now.[pcms]

*1452|
[fc]
Nevertheless, the infection spread rapidly within the base.[pcms]

*1453|
[fc]
I... I shot and killed many infected civilians and colleagues. I might[r]
have even shot people who weren't infected.[pcms]

*1454|
[fc]
There was no time to distinguish. Anyone who made even a slightly[r]
suspicious move was shot dead on the spot.[pcms]

*1455|
[fc]
Still, we had no choice but to abandon the base.[pcms]

*1456|
[fc]
Sergeant Major Nakazawa and I, along with a few remaining colleagues,[r]
escaped on the last helicopter.[pcms]

*1457|
[fc]
I can't forget the face of Captain Nakazawa on that helicopter. At[r]
that time, he had the face of a father.[pcms]

*1458|
[fc]
Everyone admired Sergeant Major Nakazawa. So when he quietly mentioned[r]
wanting to save his son, Makoto, all of us volunteered without[r]
hesitation.[pcms]

*1459|
[fc]
The captain initially refused, saying it was a personal matter. He[r]
said he would go to rescue him alone and asked us to take care of[r]
everything else.[pcms]

*1460|
[fc]
But no one agreed. It wasn't because he was his son; if there were[r]
survivors, they were simply rescue targets. We insisted it was our[r]
mission.[pcms]

*1461|
[fc]
The sight of Sergeant Major Nakazawa bowing deeply to us with the face[r]
of a father saying "I'm grateful" is vividly etched in my mind.[pcms]

*1462|
[fc]
We descended from the helicopter to the school Makoto attended.[pcms]

*1463|
[fc]
The school was overflowing with infected individuals. There too, I[r]
shot many infected people.[pcms]

*1464|
[fc]
But there were too many of them, and we had to abandon our surrounded[r]
comrades.[pcms]

*1465|
[fc]
Using the only clue we had, Makoto's mobile GPS function, we found him[r]
unconscious in the prep room; by then, it was just the captain and me[r]
left.[pcms]

*1466|
[fc]
Makoto had a head injury at that time. Probably because of that, no[r]
matter how much we called out to him, he didn't regain consciousness.[pcms]

*1467|
[fc]
I carried Makoto on my back while the captain cleared our retreat[r]
path. After escaping from the school, we finally found a car that[r]
could move.[pcms]

*1468|
[fc]
It happened when I put Makoto down next to the carI was carrying him[r]
on my back.[pcms]

*1469|
[fc]
The captain's demeanor changed drastically.[pcms]

*1470|
[fc]
It seemed he had already been injured in a fight inside the base.[pcms]

*1471|
[fc]
His hand reached out to attack me but then retracted. The captain was[r]
fighting the virus inside him.[pcms]

*1472|
[fc]
When he barely managed to suppress it, he entrusted Makoto to me and[r]
ordered me to shoot him while he was still human.[pcms]

*1473|
[fc]
I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to kill the person I admired[r]
with my own hands.[pcms]

*1474|
[fc]
But seeing the captain in agony and his words "while I'm still human"[r]
compelled me, and right next to Makoto who was still unconscious, I[r]
shot his father dead.[pcms]

*1475|
[fc]
I... killed the only family I had, who was also like a brother to me[r]
and now could be called my loverMakoto's parent with my own hands.[pcms]

My shaking wouldn't stop. My thoughts were in disarray. The only[r]
saving grace was that I wasn't in a full-blown panic.[pcms]

I was pulled back from the dark abyss into the real world.[pcms]

The call on my cell phone was from Makoto![pcms]

"Onee-san, Onee-san, are you okay?"[pcms]

*1494|

Makoto's first words were to ask if I was okay. Something must have[r]
happened on his end. If that's the case, I don't want to worry him[r]
unnecessarily.[pcms]

"We've crossed over to a small island, and it's safe here. But I think[r]
the situation on Oogamijima, where you are, must be terrible."[pcms]

*1497|

Makoto's voice was trembling a little. The same thing that happened[r]
four years ago is happening again on the island I'm on.[pcms]

Suddenly the communication was cut off. I tried calling back, but[r]
there wasn't even a ringtone.[pcms]

*1501|

I hope it's just a breakdown in the communication network. If[r]
something happened to Makoto...[pcms]

A creepy roar came from above my head. They might be on the staircase[r]

This is bad. I shouldn't stay here. But... I'm scared. The terror from[r]
four years ago is etched into my heart.[pcms]

Help me, Makoto.[pcms]

Anyway, I have to get down...[pcms]

*1508|
[fc]
I whipped my trembling legs into action and headed down to the lower[r]
floor, nearly tumbling down the stairs.[pcms]
