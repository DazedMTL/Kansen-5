Unfortunately, this convenience store didn't have Mountain Dew either.[r]
I had no choice but to substitute it with another Score.[pcms]

*107|
[fc]
Since Senior Minami said she'd pay for everything, I left it to her[r]
and waited at the entrance of the convenience store.[pcms]

*108|
[fc]
Even so... I wonder if the campground is thriving, because the shelves[r]
in the store were more than half empty. In other words, even if what I[r]
was looking for wasn't there, the choices were limited.[pcms]

*109|
[fc]
I also noticed that this convenience store is part of the same chain[r]
as the hotel we're staying at.[pcms]

*110|
[fc]
If it's the same chain, there's a high chance they stock the same[r]
products in all their stores to avoid any hassle.[pcms]

*111|
[fc]
If that's the case, since the hotel's convenience store didn't have[r]
it, it's only natural that this one wouldn't have Mountain Dew either.[pcms]

*112|
[fc]
...But still. A convenience store at a campground feels like a[r]
mismatch to me.[pcms]

*113|
[fc]
Moreover, it seems like it's being used by the campground guests to[r]
the point where most of the products are gone.[pcms]

*114|
[fc]
Indeed, customers coming from the campground were using the[r]
convenience store in a steady stream.[pcms]

*115|
[fc]
Isn't camping usually about enjoying nature and the unusual[r]
inconveniences different from everyday life?[pcms]

*116|
[fc]
You start a fire yourself, cook rice in a pot, and have fun with[r]
friends using the food and drinks you brought.[pcms]

*117|
[fc]
I might be a perfect indoor person to say this, but if that's the[r]
case, there's no need to come to a campground, right?[pcms]

*118|
[fc]
Sure, convenience stores are handy, and the owner must know they'll[r]
sell well to keep running them, but it feels off to me.[pcms]

*119|
[fc]
Or maybe I'm the strange one for thinking about this. Maybe it's fine[r]
to just use them if they're there without thinking too much about it.[pcms]

I was so deep in thought that I didn't notice Senior Minami coming out[r]

"It's convenient, isn't it? It reduces what you need to carry.[r]
Especially if you're on a bike or walking instead of driving, you'd[r]

supplies locally is pretty common."[pcms]

Rustling the convenience store bag, Senior Minami started walking[r]
towards the campground. I hurriedly followed after her.[pcms]

The campground was quite large and very popular.[pcms]

*133|
[fc]
Tents of various sizes, colors, and shapes were crowded together. Cars[r]
with distant license plates of various models were parked all around.[pcms]

*134|
[fc]
I honestly didn't expect it to be this bustling, but maybe it's[r]
because of various events happening.[pcms]

*135|
[fc]
Normally, it might be a quieter place where you can feel more in touch[r]
with nature.[pcms]

*136|

I hope that's the case.[pcms]

*137|
[fc]
After all, there are groups having BBQs or setting off fireworks[r]
between tents, probably drunk, and they're quite noisy.[pcms]

*138|
[fc]
If it's this crowded with people, nature doesn't stand a chance. It[r]
makes sense why the convenience store is busy too.[pcms]

[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"That might be true."[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"It's well-maintained, isn't it? Ah... If there's a convenience store[r]

Walking side by side, Senior Minami's face suddenly turned sour. It[r]
was the same expression she had when we left Ochi-san's mansion...[r]
Maybe I shouldn't talk about the owner or the Maeda family too much.[pcms]

*145|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"...Oh right. My sister said she saw someone who looked a lot like[r]
Senior Minami at a pool in Shibuya gym..."[pcms]

She made an exaggerated scratching gesture on her head, her face[r]
returning to the usual Senior Minami.[pcms]

Yeah. It seems like changing the topic was the right move.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_b"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st09"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_stk s="satuki_st0016"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"But I didn't think she had noticed me."[pcms]

*152|

It's true my sister stands out, but I think Senior Minami also has[r]
quite an eye-catching presence.[pcms]

*153|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Not at all. My sister said, 'She's a girl with a beautiful form.'"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st30"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

end too.[pcms]

But it would be a waste to remain silent when I'm alone with Senior[r]

Senior Minami talked about it nonchalantly, without any sign of[r]
embarrassment. Maybe it's just something from the past for her.[pcms]

*164|

[vo_stk s="satuki_st0021"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]

landscapes can still make for beautiful pictures, right?"[pcms]

I don't quite understand, but I can tell that Senior Minami is drawn[r]
to landscapes.[pcms]

*167|

"Sometimes I do. But landscapes aren't just about nature; factory[r]
complexes, old apartment blocks, and ruins are all landscapes too.[r]
There are quite a few places nearby."[pcms]

*169|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"I see... That makes sense."[pcms]

*170|
[fc]
Come to think of it, I've heard about photo collections of factories[r]
and ruins before.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st30"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*172|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"No, it's like a revelation. To someone who understands, even the[r]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*173|
[fc]
[vo_stk s="satuki_st0024"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"That's right~. There are various kinds of landscapes, each with its[r]
own flavor."[pcms]

*174|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"I've learned a lot."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st30"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*176|

Thank goodness. It's Senior Minami's usual smile.[pcms]

*177|
[fc]
After that, we continued to get excited talking about photography for[r]
a while. Our steps felt lighter somehow.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st03"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_stk s="satuki_st0026"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"Look, that's our tent over there."[pcms]

*179|
[fc]
We seemed to have walked quite a distance from the entrance. Maybe we[r]
had come to about the middle of the campsite.[pcms]

*180|
[fc]
This area seemed to be for customers on bikes, bicycles, or on foot.[r]
The plots were cut into smaller sections.[pcms]

*181|
[fc]
Senior Minami pointed out a small tent in one corner. There were[r]
rental bicycles parked beside it.[pcms]

*182|
[fc]
The tent seemed small when viewed from the ship, but now that it was[r]
set up, it looked quite large. Maybe two adults could sleep in it.[pcms]

*183|
[fc]
And something about its construction and color scheme felt stylish.[pcms]

*184|
[fc]
When you think of tents, you imagine limited colors and shapes, like[r]
the old-fashioned triangular tents with a 'shabby' image.[pcms]

*185|
[fc]
But now, looking at the tents along the way, they've become quite[r]
varied.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*188|
[fc]
I started to feel a little nervous.[pcms]

*189|
[fc]
After all, I was being invited into a girl's space, even if it was[r]
just a tent. It's a rather confined space too. The hint that she had[r]
something to talk about also heightened my sense of anticipation.[pcms]
