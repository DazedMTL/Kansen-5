[fc]
Though he did a backflip with joy, Souichirou, who failed to land[r]
properly, hit his head and was sitting dizzily on the ground.[pcms]

*1248|
[fc]
While applying an ice pack borrowed from the infirmary to his head, he[r]
sipped on tea from the vending machine.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="so1_se_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_so03a"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=340 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Ah... I'm really looking forward to summer vacation."[pcms]

*1250|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Who would have thought it would turn out like this."[pcms]

*1251|
[fc]
Not only accompanying the cheerleading camp but also being together[r]
with Senior Minami.[pcms]

*1252|
[fc]
It wasn't just Souichirou; it seemed like it was going to be a fun[r]
summer vacation.[pcms]

*1253|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"How about we go to the best spot for a little morale boost?"[pcms]

*1254|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"At this time, it might be just right."[pcms]

*1255|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Alright, I'll bring the camera."[pcms]

*1256|
[fc]
Souichirou sprang up from the ground and started walking towards the[r]
audio-visual room.[pcms]

*1257|
[fc]
It seems he has completely recovered.[pcms]

*1258|
[fc]
It might be a bit awkward if the drama club is there, but they should[r]
forgive us for just fetching some equipment.[pcms]

*1259|
[fc]
I followed Souichirou towards the audio-visual room as well.[pcms]

*1260|
[fc]
[ns]Souichirou[nse]
"Yes, yes, this place is shining at its best today as well."[pcms]

*1261|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"If it weren't, it wouldn't be called the best spot."[pcms]

*1262|
[fc]
The best position isn't about the location of one's crotch or how well[r]
an antenna receives signals.[pcms]

*1263|
[fc]
This place had become invaluable for watching and filming the[r]
activities of various clubs practicing on the grounds or in the gym,[r]
especially the cheerleading club.[pcms]

*1264|
[fc]
From the audio-visual room, a digital camera with a single-lens reflex[r]
was also prepared.[pcms]

*1265|
[fc]
It's not some irrelevant bundle sold to dads buying computers; it's a[r]
current entry-level model.[pcms]

*1266|
[fc]
It might be a bit expensive for school equipment, but Uguisudani[r]
Academy, where we go, is quite understanding for a metropolitan[r]
school.[pcms]

*1267|
[fc]
The academy is located south of Shibuya Station, beyond Tamagawa[r]
Street, and like Kinnan Academy to the north, it has a new building[r]
created from school consolidation.[pcms]

*1268|
[fc]
The differences in uniforms, with ribbons or ties depending on the[r]
department, are remnants of that time.[pcms]

*1269|
[fc]
Originally being a public school focused on academic advancement, it[r]
had a high deviation value.[pcms]

*1270|
[fc]
Among its alumni are politicians who became ministers, as well as many[r]
notable figures in music, writing, and theater; even now, the cultural[r]
clubs are thriving.[pcms]

*1271|
[fc]
On the other hand, sports weren't very strong, as seen when the[r]
baseball club was easily defeated in the first round.[pcms]

*1272|
[fc]
Due to the size of the grounds, the baseball and soccer clubs take[r]
turns using the field.[pcms]

*1273|
[fc]
We couldn't possibly compete with schools that focus on sports and[r]
have classes only in the morning, with club activities all afternoon.[pcms]

*1274|
[fc]
Even so, basketball and volleyball are decent, weightlifting and judo[r]
are fair, but they're still far from national level.[pcms]

*1275|
[fc]
In contrast, swimming is doing quite well, but we can't match Kinnan[r]
Academy, which boasts Yuuho, a candidate for the Olympics.[pcms]

*1276|
[fc]
However, the cheerleading club I'm in charge of is quite strong.[pcms]

*1277|
[fc]
It's a promising club with experience winning metropolitan[r]
tournaments.[pcms]

*1278|
[fc]
From the best position, I watch over the cheerleading club's practice[r]
through the viewfinder.[pcms]

*1279|
[fc]
Surely Souichirou too has the same subject at the center of his rule[r]
of thirds.[pcms]

*1280|
[fc]
Healthy thighs and slightly bulging butt. Despite her petite frame,[r]
her breasts sway left and right, up and down; she was one step away[r]
from fulfilling the dream of being a loli with big breasts.[pcms]

*1281|
[fc]
Her name is Akari; she's one year junior to me and a first-year[r]
student.[pcms]

*1282|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0001"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"Go! Go!"[pcms]

*1283|
[fc]
From high V to low V, then punch up, T-motion, she moves swiftly,[r]
giving a glimpse of her panties.[pcms]

*1284|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0002"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"Let's Go!"[pcms]

*1285|
[fc]
She shakes her pom-poms finely in time with the music, moving her arms[r]
and legs up and down vigorously.[pcms]

*1286|
[fc]
My luck ran out when I was brought into the newspaper club by[r]
Souichirou and became the deputy in charge of the cheerleading club. I[r]
quickly became a big fan of hers.[pcms]

*1287|
[fc]
But my encounter with Ochi-san dates back even further, to last[r]
summer.[pcms]

*1288|
[fc]
When I happened to see Ochi-san in front of Shibuya station, I fell in[r]
love at first sight with her, not even knowing her name.[pcms]

*1289|
[fc]
Of course, I couldn't possibly approach her to speak, and I spent days[r]
regretting it, but fate would bring us together again.[pcms]

*1290|
[fc]
It was the day I became in charge of the cheerleading club in the[r]
newspaper club and went to greet them with my senior.[pcms]

*1291|
[fc]
While everyone else gave perfunctory or formulaic responses, it was[r]
Ochi-san who bowed deeply and greeted us.[pcms]

*1292|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0003"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"I am Akari Ochi. I look forward to working with you."[pcms]

*1293|
[fc]
The joy of being able to meet again and the shock of hearing Ochi-[r]
san's voice for the first time are unforgettable even now.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak2_se2_sp"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ak01_sp"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1294|
[fc]
Even when I later heard from Ochi-san that she thought I was a[r]
classmate for a while, my heart did not waver.[pcms]

*1295|
[fc]
I thought it was strange that she called me Nakazawa-kun instead of[r]
senior, but I think it also became an opportunity for us to grow[r]
closer.[pcms]

*1296|
[fc]
The nickname "Ma-kun" given to me by Hanazawa-san from the[r]
cheerleading club is a jab at my short stature and feminine face, and[r]
at first, it made me feel bad.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak2_se2_sp"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ak03_sp"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1297|
[fc]
But strangely, when Ochi-san calls me that, I don't mind at all; in[r]
fact, it has become one of my favorite words because humans are so[r]
conveniently made.[pcms]

*1298|
[fc]
Since then, I've been called "Ma-kun senior" as if I were a younger[r]
brother... Ochi-san is seriously an angel.[pcms]

*1299|
[fc]
Before that incident happened, maybe it was because she resembled[r]
someone I liked, but now that doesn't matter at all.[pcms]

*1300|
[fc]
By the way, a classmate from the soccer club was saying something[r]
strange.[pcms]

*1301|
[fc]
"Since Arai from the ace team seems to be good friends with Ochi-san[r]
from childhood, maybe you shouldn't get too close..." or something[r]
like that.[pcms]

*1303|
[fc]
Ochi-san is moving her body with joy. It's a sight that makes even me[r]
itch to move my body.[pcms]

*1304|
[fc]
Whether they're good friends as popular figures of the school or not,[r]
this is also part of the newspaper club's activities.[pcms]

*1305|
[fc]
Even if they tell me not to get close, what am I supposed to do?[pcms]

*1306|
[fc]
Besides, I feel like Ochi-san has taken a liking to me.[pcms]

*1307|
[fc]
She's bright and kind to everyone, so it might just seem that way.[pcms]

"What kind of taste is that! I'd pay 100,000 yen for that!"[pcms]

When I took my eyes off the viewfinder and looked towards the source[r]
of the voice, there was a woman taking photos just like us.[pcms]

"Senior Minami!"[pcms]

"Hi there, you guys are getting along well, taking sneaky photos."[pcms]

*1332|
[fc]
Senior Minami, who had been pointing her camera towards the[r]
cheerleading squad, took her eyes off the viewfinder and gave a light[r]
laugh.[pcms]

[evcg storage="satuki_N001a"][trans_c cross time=500]

*1332a|
[fc]
Senior Satsuki is in charge of photographing the cheerleading squad[r]
for the photography club.[pcms]

*1333|
[fc]
Although I'm responsible for writing the cheerleading articles for the[r]
newspaper club, the photos that get published are taken by Senior[r]
Minami.[pcms]

*1334|
[fc]
She has a friendly personality and is a bright person who doesn't hold[r]
grudges or scatter stress around.[pcms]

*1335|
[fc]
Moreover, it seems she's quite skilled at photography, having won an[r]
award at a major competition in the past.[pcms]

*1336|
[fc]
It's perfect to work with someone who has both a great personality and[r]
skills.[pcms]

*1337|
[fc]
Furthermore, she's as beautiful as Ochi-san, if not more so.[pcms]

*1338|
[fc]
She's a talented woman who can handle both land and water, close and[r]
far ranges, light and darkness, strength and intelligence.[pcms]

*1339|
[fc]
Naturally, her popularity within the school is not low.[pcms]

*1340|
[fc]
She's an overachiever who is liked by both genders.[pcms]

*1341|
[fc]
Last spring, there was an incident where a senior in charge of[r]
covering the cheerleading squad misunderstood Senior Minami's[r]
friendliness and fell for her.[pcms]

*1342|
[fc]
He even confessed his feelings, but of course, it was a complete[r]
rejection.[pcms]

*1343|
[fc]
Her approachable demeanor might be sinfully misleading to naive boys.[pcms]

While talking with Senior Minami, it seems they've finished practice[r]
and are taking a break.[pcms]

"Her plump butt is turned this way, and it looks like she's rummaging[r]

*1375|

This completely off-guard, vulnerable look is irresistible.[pcms]

*1376|
[fc]
Peeking is an act that touches something in a man's heartstrings, I[r]
was convinced of that at this moment.[pcms]

*1377|
[fc]
The sensual and smooth curve of her butt wrapped in a short skirt is[r]
just perfect.[pcms]

[fc]
They say that clothes are more erotic than nudity, but I want to see[r]
both.[pcms]

[fc]
If I were to have sex with Akari-san, I'd start fully clothed, rubbing[r]
against her here and there before cumming inside her once.[pcms]

*1380|
[fc]
Then, slowly undressing her for the second round while she's half-[r]
naked.[pcms]

*1381|
[fc]
Finally, fully enjoying her naked form before going for the third[r]
round seems appropriate.[pcms]

*1382|
[fc]
The sight of Akari-san disheveled while still dressed is irresistible,[r]
and her erotic half-naked appearance is also hard to give up.[pcms]

*1383|
[fc]
I wanted to thoroughly spoil Akari-san, who would be covered in shame[r]
while I ask her about the meaning of standing naked before me.[pcms]
