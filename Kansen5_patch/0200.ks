I rubbed my aching chest and began setting up the handheld game[r]
console and the TV.[pcms]

;//★room10c 誠と夏都のアパートリビング・夜
[bg storage="room10c"][trans_c cross time=500]

*2578|
[fc]
I connected the cable that usually extends from the D-terminal of the[r]
TV to the output terminal of the shiny black handheld game console.[pcms]

*2579|
[fc]
By doing this, I could enjoy games on a TV-sized screen instead of the[r]
small screen of the handheld.[pcms]

*2581|
[fc]
Having finished a task, I looked up at the ceiling with a dazed[r]
expression and let out a sigh.[pcms]

*2582|
[fc]
It was an indescribably languid time.[pcms]

*2583|
[fc]
I couldn't think of anything shameful. It was truly a state of[r]
enlightenment.[pcms]

*2584|
[fc]
Then, suddenly, the hands of the wall clock caught my eye.[pcms]

*2585|
[fc]
It's 21:55, almost 22:00...[pcms]

*2586|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"What?!"[pcms]

*2587|
[fc]
Not good, I had arranged to meet with Souichi at 22:00.[pcms]

*2588|
[fc]
I connected the cable that was still attached to the D-terminal TV to[r]
the output terminal of the shiny black handheld game console.[pcms]

*2589|
[fc]
By doing this, I could enjoy games on a TV-sized screen instead of the[r]
small screen of the handheld.[pcms]

*2590|
[fc]
I cut open the bag of potato chips I had left half-finished from the[r]
back so it would be easier to take them out.[pcms]

*2591|
[fc]
There was no turning back now. It was either eat them all or let them[r]
get soggy.[pcms]

*2592|
[fc]
This time's flavor was summer pizza.[pcms]

*2593|
[fc]
The spicy taste of Tabasco mixed with the rich flavor of cheese and[r]
the tanginess of tomato made for an exceptional snack.[pcms]

*2594|
[fc]
I placed my chopsticks at the opening of the bag.[pcms]

*2595|
[fc]
Since grabbing them with my hands would make them dirty, chopsticks[r]
were definitely the way to go in times like these.[pcms]

*2596|
[fc]
Before turning on the game, I checked to make sure I hadn't forgotten[r]
anything.[pcms]

*2597|
[fc]
My beloved Mountain Dew was sweating, waiting for the moment to be[r]
consumed by me.[pcms]

*2598|
[fc]
The potato chips and chopsticks were ready, exposed in anticipation of[r]
being finished off.[pcms]

*2599|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Alright..."[pcms]

*2600|
[fc]
There was nothing left to fear anymore.[pcms]

*2601|
[fc]
I psyched myself up, turned on the TV, switched the input, and powered[r]
on the handheld game console.[pcms]

When the start screen appeared, I chose to connect online, checked my[r]
ID and password, and logged in.[pcms]

*2603|
[fc]
There was a brief loading screen.[pcms]

*2604|
[fc]
I loved this moment, feeling as if it were a boundary between the real[r]
world and another realm.[pcms]

*2605|
[fc]

"Monster Buster 5," also known as "5IE," was a hit game spanning five[r]
series entries.[pcms]

*2608|
[fc]
Excluding certain national RPGs, reaching a fifth series entry might[r]
be considered quite a long run.[pcms]

;//めも：ちょっと遊びます。

*2609|
[fc]
The staff must be grateful to have been allowed to create up to a[r]
fifth series.[pcms]

*2610|
[fc]
Monster Buster has different builds for both consumer versions and PC[r]
versions, making it not only popular among enthusiasts but also widely[r]
adopted by the general public.[pcms]

*2611|
[fc]
Gory scenes where you kill harmless herbivores for food or where blood[r]
spurts from wounded parts when attacked mean that industry ratings[r]
have been set for this game.[pcms]

*2612|
[fc]
It's unusual for a game that completely excludes children to become[r]
such a popular hit in Japan.[pcms]

*2613|
[fc]
"Monster Buster 5 Island Edition"[pcms]

*2614|
[fc]
This MO title is an action game that doesn't fit into the common[r]
pattern of endlessly defeating minions before a boss battle.[pcms]

*2615|
[fc]
It's basically one boss battle after another.[pcms]

*2616|
[fc]
The minions are positioned as nothing more than a nuisance during boss[r]
battles, which is one of its unique features.[pcms]

*2617|
[fc]
And the characters do not grow at all; the game was specialized in[r]
equipping gear.[pcms]

*2618|
[fc]
Instead of the so-called leveling up, you have to improve your own[r]
skills.[pcms]

*2619|
[fc]
Weapons and armor are important, but it's troublesome if you don't[r]
learn the enemy's motions and behavior patterns.[pcms]

*2620|
[fc]
And the monsters that appear online are all enhanced compared to[r]
offline, with difficulty settings designed for party play.[pcms]

*2621|
[fc]
It's possible to play solo, but it's easier and more fun with a party.[pcms]

*2622|
[fc]
I mostly formed parties with Souichi and traveled through the game[r]
world.[pcms]

In MonBuster, traditionally you fight monsters in parties of 1-4[r]
people, so coordination and cooperation are important systems.[pcms]

*2641|
[fc]
In a game with many action elements, just one person doing something[r]
reckless can lead to devastating damage.[pcms]

*2642|
[fc]
The defense type takes on the monster's attacks, the support type[r]
inflicts status ailments and heals, and the attacker deals damage.[pcms]

*2643|
[fc]
There's also a tactic called 'locking down,' but we weren't at all[r]
interested in doing that.[pcms]

*2644|
[fc]
As the need for such coordination arises, the members of the party[r]
tend to become fixed.[pcms]
