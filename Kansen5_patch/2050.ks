I managed to return to the tent without attracting the attention of[r]
the lurking figures, somehow making it back safely.[pcms]

*930|
[fc]
At first glance, it seems that the tent where Senior Minami is[r]
sleeping is still okay. Still, I carefully unzipped the entrance and[r]
entered.[pcms]

[bg storage="tent01a"][trans_c cross time=500]

*931|

Senior is still sleeping soundly. Relieved, I made sure to close the[r]
entrance properly.[pcms]

"Senior... Senior Minami..."[pcms]

*933|

I shook Senior's shoulder gently, trying to wake her up with a soft[r]

Just then, there was a sound like someone scratching at the tent.[pcms]

In a split second, I hugged Senior Minami and whispered into her ear.[pcms]

*946|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Their eyes were red. When that person turned around. Looking around,[r]
there were quite a few of them wandering, and screams were coming from[r]

The sound of something scratching at the tent was getting louder. If[r]
they wanted to, they could easily break through the tent...[pcms]

*950|
[fc]
[vo_stk s="satuki_st0149"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"Eek!"[pcms]

*951|
[fc]
Senior Minami clung to me with a frightened face, trembling slightly.[r]
My hands shaking, I hugged her back tightly.[pcms]

*952|

"Kyaaah! Nooo! Don't come here!"[pcms]

*953|
[fc]
The sound of a woman's scream and the noise of frantic footsteps came[r]
from outside. I pulled Senior Minami closer to me even more tightly. I[r]
could feel her body trembling more intensely.[pcms]

;//‰F‚±‚±‚Åƒeƒ“ƒg‚ğ‚Ğ‚Á‚©‚­‰¹‚ğÁ‚µ‚Ä‰º‚³‚¢

*954|
[fc]
Suddenly, the presence of someone at the tent entrance disappeared.[r]
The scratching sounds stopped as well.[pcms]

*955|
[fc]
They must have been drawn away by the earlier screams.[pcms]

*956|
[fc]
While holding the trembling Senior, I cautiously removed the cover[r]
from the tent window to peek outside.[pcms]

*957|
[fc]
It was a hellish scene, just like four years ago.[pcms]

*958|
[fc]
Unsteady footsteps, many people wandering aimlessly with their[r]
distinctive red eyes occasionally reflecting light.[pcms]

*959|
[fc]
Regardless of gender, intermittent screams and what seemed like death[r]
throes could be heard, and the campsite was in turmoil during the[r]
quietest time before dawn.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st32"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"Uh... uh..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*961|
[fc]
Senior Minami's trembling wouldn't stop. But I was trembling too. We[r]
both knew about the tragedy from four years ago.[pcms]

*962|
[fc]
This trembling was because we knew. It was unbearably frightening...[pcms]

*963|
[fc]
But why is this happening on this island? It's far too distant from[r]
where it happened four years ago.[pcms]

*964|
[fc]
I always had a vague sense of unease. Always wondering what if it[r]
happened again.[pcms]

*965|
[fc]
The tragedy before my eyes seemed like a nightmare, but it was[r]
reality. If that's the case, we have to escape...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st07"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*966|
[fc]
I have to survive this with Senior Minami no matter what![pcms]

*967|
[fc]
I quietly replaced the cover and steeled my resolve.[pcms]

*968|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Senior Minami... Let's survive this together. Absolutely. To do that,[r]
I think it's dangerous to stay in the tent."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st14"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*970|
[fc]
Startled, Senior Minami looked up sharply. As her trembling stopped,[r]
the frightened expression on her face vanished, replaced by a look of[r]
clear determination.[pcms]

*971|
[fc]
[vo_stk s="satuki_st0152"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"That's right. If we get attacked by them here and end up joining[r]
their ranks, it would make the survival from four years ago[r]
meaningless."[pcms]

*972|
[fc]
Senior Minami nodded solemnly and gently pulled away from my arms.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st03"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_stk s="satuki_st0153"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"Thank you..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*974|
[fc]
She said softly and began rummaging through her bag to change into[r]
different clothes. They looked very easy to move in...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st1_t1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="f1_st01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*975|
[fc]
No, not that it's the time for this... but she's wearing a T-shirt and[r]
leggings with no panties or bra.[pcms]

*976|
[fc]
The nipples were clearly pushing up against the fabric, and as for the[r]
lower half, the cleft of her mound was distinctly visible! The fabric[r]
was snug, or rather, it fit perfectly.[pcms]

*977|
[fc]
I like this. If we manage to escape, I definitely want to have clothed[r]
sex with her in this outfit![pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st1_t1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="f1_st11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=300 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*978|
[fc]
[vo_stk s="satuki_st0154"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"...What?"[pcms]

*979|
[fc]
I might have stared a bit too lewdly. This isn't the time for that.[r]
Ah, what am I thinking...[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*980|
[fc]
Senior Minami gave me a puzzled look and started packing without[r]
waiting for my answer.[pcms]

*981|
[fc]
While watching her, I removed the window cover again to look outside.[r]
The commotion seemed to have grown even though it should have been[r]
just a moment.[pcms]

*982|
[fc]
The number of those wandering around seemed to have increased, and the[r]
screams from afar seemed more numerous.[pcms]

*983|
[fc]
This means that they might be moving around even to the edges of the[r]
campsite, increasing the number of victims.[pcms]

*984|
[fc]
I thought about running away earlier, but it seems the damage has[r]
spread considerably. If that's the case, I wonder where and how we[r]
should escape.[pcms]

I collided with one of the infected and almost lost my balance, but I[r]
managed to prevent a face-first collision with the ground by putting[r]
out one hand first.[pcms]

The infected that I bumped into also lost balance and couldn't[r]

Questioned again, I thought it over. Indeed, Senior Minami was right.[pcms]

It's hard to imagine easily riding through this chaos on a bicycle.[r]
After all, it's only human-powered.[pcms]

If we hit or get hit by them, we'd be out immediately. We probably[r]
