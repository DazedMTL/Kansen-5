Tears were overflowing in their eyes as well. It might have been to[r]
endure the fear.[pcms]

*2530|
[fc]
But even in those tears, I felt a strange sense of solidarity.[pcms]

*2531|
[fc]
Because they said I was their best friend. Because they said it[r]
wouldn't work unless the three of us were together.[pcms]

*2532|

Their words encouraged me. Thanks to them, I was able to leap into the[r]
room they were heading towards.[pcms]

Kubota-san, who had fled into the prep room with me, was calling out[r]
to them.[pcms]

*2536|
[fc]
Because of my friends' friendship and reassurance, the emotions I had[r]
been holding back exploded, and the tears and voice that had been[r]
dammed up came flooding out all at once.[pcms]

Letting our guard down was a mistake. Before we knew it, we were[r]

My best friends who had saved me were now waiting for my help.[pcms]

While being attacked by an unknown monster, they were desperately[r]

*2551|
[fc]
But my heart had completely given up, and I didn't have the legs to[r]
move for them.[pcms]

If I jumped out now, I might be able to save them, but I might also[r]
get caught...[pcms]

We struggled fiercely, and Kubota-san and I fell to the floor while[r]

I was overwhelmed with fear and affection, and the soft sensation,[r]
everything was mixed up as I clung to Kubota-san's body.[pcms]

Like a beast that had lost its reason, I clung to her as if devouring[r]
