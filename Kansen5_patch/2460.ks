I ended up being a burden after all. That's why I didn't want to bring[r]
someone who has never fought with us.[pcms]

All that woman did was treat us like guinea pigs indoors.[pcms]

*4050|

I'm so pissed off.[pcms]

What a good opportunity. Who says I have to help anyone? They should[r]
just take care of themselves.[pcms]

Blood spurts from her eyes. Her resisting hand drops, and Misao-san[r]
stops moving.[pcms]

*4060|

My body is shaking. Guilt for not helping is accusing me. But[r]
somewhere inside me, a voice is shouting "serves you right." I decide[r]

After knocking down so many, my palms start to feel the pain. To catch[r]
my breath, I immediately hide in the shadows.[pcms]

*4065|
[fc]
From here on, I'll return to the assembly hall while staying hidden[r]

The last image of Misao-san comes back to me. Blood spurting from her[r]

a lifeless lump of flesh...[pcms]

The pale yellow vomit with bubbling foam forms a puddle. If there is[r]
such a thing as a conscience inside me, it finally seems satisfied,[r]
and the nausea begins to subside.[pcms]

*4080|
[fc]
I wipe my mouth and catch my breath. I cover the vomit with sand from[r]
my foot.[pcms]

*4081|
[fc]
I'll have to make excuses to Makoto-kun now. But considering the[r]
current situation, if I just say I couldn't save her, he might[r]
understand...[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=500][hide_chara_int]

*4082|

It'll be fine. I can handle this. I don't want to lose Makoto-kun. I[r]
have to be careful not to let him see through my nausea...[pcms]

I doubted my ears. I wanted to believe it was a lie. I had to check...[r]
if it was true... if Makoto-kun had... betrayed me...[pcms]

*4090|
[fc]
It was when I made up my mind that the spell on my body was finally[r]
broken. I tiptoed towards the room where Akari-san was supposed to be[r]
sleeping.[pcms]

*4091|

From inside, I could hear heavy breathing. And then, the words I[r]
didn't want to hear reached my ears again.[pcms]

"...I love you, I love you, Akari."[pcms]

My body trembled with rage. My blood boiled in an instant. Of all[r]

The granddaughter of the man who took my family from me, and she's[r]
being taken by him. And on top of that, he says he loves her? What is[r]
he talking about?[pcms]

I thought it was only Makoto-kun. I thought he was the only one who[r]
could accept me, someone in the same situation as me.[pcms]

*4096|
[fc]
It must have been that body of Ochi Akari that tempted him. But[r]
Makoto-kun also betrayed me so easily.[pcms]

*4097|
[fc]
It's frustrating... sad! I thought I had found someone to walk with[r]
me.[pcms]

*4098|
[fc]
I won't forgive... Ochi Akari. I won't forgive you... Makoto.[pcms]

*4099|
[fc]
But... but then I'll be alone again. I don't want to be alone anymore.[r]
Pretend I didn't hear anything, forgive Makoto-kun, and stay together.[r]
Ochi Akari can be dealt with somehow.[pcms]

*4100|

If need be, I could even make her follow in my aunt's footsteps...[pcms]

*4101|
[fc]
...What am I thinking?[pcms]

*4102|
[fc]
I absolutely don't want to be alone again. But... but that doesn't[r]
mean it's okay to dispose of Ochi Akari.[pcms]
