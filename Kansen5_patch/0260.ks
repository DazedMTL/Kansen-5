From the groups of girls, there seem to be blatant glares of[r]

As dusk approached after the afternoon practice, we were eating dinner[r]

Everyone from Uguisudani Academy, both teachers and students, gathered[r]

Makoto and I were eating quietly at the very end or rather on the[r]

It's bad for boys to have their secret pleasures seen by girls.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Ugh..."[pcms]

[fc]
If I could confirm that, I wouldn't be having such a hard time, but[r]
with no point of contact to speak of, I can't just go up and talk to[r]
her.[pcms]

*3515|
[fc]
Or maybe she got angry because I tried to take a photo of her without[r]
permission since she's a cosplayer?[pcms]

*3516|
[fc]
No, no, that's too convenient of an assumption. Normally, anyone would[r]
get angry if their photo was taken without consent.[pcms]

As I tried to take my phone back from Frank-senpai, Hanazawa snatched[r]
it from the side before I could.[pcms]

Hanazawa made an overtly disgusted face as she looked at the image on[r]

Hanazawa glared at me with a face full of genuine disgust.[pcms]

Even coming from Hanazawa, being looked at with such a face by a girl[r]

Hanazawa wasn't just looking at that image; she was moving her fingers[r]

Hanazawa's face, which had been startled, turned increasingly into one[r]
of discomfort.[pcms]

*3536|
[fc]
She looked at the images on the phone as if she were looking at slugs[r]
or house centipedes.[pcms]

*3537|
[fc]
I wonder what she's looking at... I just want this moment to end.[pcms]

There, an image of Ochi-san working hard in the cheerleading club was[r]
displayed, looking beautiful.[pcms]

The Ochi-san in the image had a refreshing smile, which made it all[r]

The real Ochi-san was glancing at me while turning bright red and[r]

"That's enough already! Isn't it enough?"[pcms]
