*1966|
[fc]
After parting ways with senior Minami who lives in Tomigaya 2-chome, I[r]
finished shopping in front of Yoyogi-Hachiman Station and returned to[r]
the apartment where I live with my sister.[pcms]

*1967|
[fc]
The cost of living might be a bit high, but I feel like the city[r]
center is really convenient after all.[pcms]

*1968|
[fc]
It's not just food, but also renting DVDs, going to convenience[r]
stores, and having banks and post offices nearby everything you need is[r]
scattered around.[pcms]

*1969|
[fc]
But, the most convenient thing might be the transportation network.[pcms]

*1970|
[fc]
No matter where you walk, you bump into a station, and there are buses[r]
going here and there.[pcms]

*1971|
[fc]
As someone who lived in Akita, I can't help but find this area[r]
convenient.[pcms]

*1972|
[fc]
I put the groceries I bought into the fridge and decide to polish the[r]
rice.[pcms]

I want to polish the rice and turn on the rice cooker before my sister[r]
comes back from the bookstore.[pcms]

*1974|
[fc]
For the two of us at the dining table, cooking two cups of rice is[r]
more than enough, even leaving some leftover for tomorrow's breakfast.[pcms]

But it's tricky; too short for a belt, too long for a sash. One cup is[r]
not enough.[pcms]

*1976|

In the end, it turned out that making onigiri with the leftover rice[r]
and freezing them was the most efficient way.[pcms]

*1978|

As I silently polish the rice, words and images come and go in my[r]
mind.[pcms]

*1979|
[fc]
Today was a day full of surprises, but Ochi-san's matter was[r]
particularly astonishing among them.[pcms]

*1980|
[fc]
She's not just cute; I thought her atmosphere was different from other[r]
girls, but I never imagined she'd be such a lady.[pcms]

*1981|
[fc]
It's just that her family environment happened to be one where her[r]
mother doesn't indulge in luxuries, but her lineage and skills are[r]
truly that of a lady.[pcms]

*1982|
[fc]
Tea ceremony and flower arrangement aside, naginata is not something[r]
many people practice, I believe.[pcms]

*1983|
[fc]
It felt like a skill befitting the daughter of a samurai family.[pcms]

*1984|
[fc]
Her mother must also be a beautiful woman with high status.[pcms]

*1985|
[fc]
Kind to others, strict with herself and her family.[pcms]

*1986|
[fc]
Uplifting men, while she herself remains modest and unobtrusive, yet[r]
firmly supporting her partner.[pcms]

[se buf=0 storage="seD005"]
;//…‚ğ—¬‚·

*1987|
[fc]
There's something about Ochi-san that makes me expect such qualities[r]
from her.[pcms]

*1988|
[fc]
Even for modern men, such a woman is still one of the ideals.[pcms]

*1989|
[fc]
We've been on good terms to a moderate extent until now, but we've[r]
never had such a deep conversation before.[pcms]

*1990|
[fc]
Considering I knew nothing about her family or her extracurricular[r]
lessons, it feels like we've closed the distance between us[r]
significantly in just one day.[pcms]

*1991|
[fc]
It's not just Ochi-san; it's the same with senior Minami.[pcms]

*1992|
[fc]
I wonder if we've ever spent such a long time talking together like[r]
this before.[pcms]

*1993|
[fc]
It was always official business related to club activities; casual[r]
chit-chat was rare, I think.[pcms]

*1994|
[fc]
Come to think of it, though I didn't ask in depth, why does senior[r]
Minami live alone?[pcms]

[stopse buf=0]
;<SoundRun 2,Stop,ON,2000>

*1995|
[fc]
I understand everyone has their circumstances, but living alone seems[r]
unusual.[pcms]

*1996|
[fc]
Even if there are some problems at home, one wouldn't normally live[r]
alone; if there are too many problems, it would lead to facilities and[r]
other complicated issues.[pcms]

*1997|
[fc]
She doesn't seem to be working part-time to earn living expenses, so[r]
she must not be financially troubled...[pcms]

*1998|
[fc]
While her mysteriousness is part of her charm, I can't help but be[r]
curious about it.[pcms]

*1999|
[fc]
If she got along well with her family, she wouldn't be living alone,[r]
so I have to be careful not to ask anything strange.[pcms]

*2000|
[fc]
It's awkward for both parties if you delve too much into someone[r]
else's privacy anyway.[pcms]

"By the way..."[pcms]

*2002|
[fc]
There were some not-so-honorable rumors circulating about senior[r]
Minami.[pcms]

*2003|
[fc]
In schools all over Japan, there's what you'd call suspicion of[r]
compensated dating.[pcms]

*2004|
[fc]
Being as beautiful as she is with a good personality, maybe they can't[r]
find anything else to attack her with unless they fabricate such[r]
stories; I occasionally hear them.[pcms]

*2005|
[fc]
Sometimes I think that in an era where monoliths could turn Jupiter[r]
into a sun, such rumors wouldn't spread, but they still bother me[r]
nonetheless.[pcms]

*2006|
[fc]
There were sightings of her with a salaryman in a suit in town, or a[r]
woman who looked like senior Minami playing in a club, and then[r]
disappearing into the hotel district of Dogenzaka...[pcms]

[stopse buf=0]
;<SoundRun 2,Stop,ON,2000>

*2007|
[fc]
Some of the nastier rumors even claim there are videos of her out[r]
there, or that she charged fifty thousand yen for a night.[pcms]

;//m:ƒrƒfƒI¨“®‰æ@‚Æ‚µ‚Ä‚¨‚­

*2008|
[fc]
It's true that she has an unusual sex appeal, so it might not be just[r]
jealousy from other girls, but rather the explosion of male fantasies.[pcms]

*2009|
[fc]
It feels all too typical to steer the conversation towards such sexual[r]
topics.[pcms]

*2010|
[fc]
But she's straightforward by nature, and I don't get the vibe that[r]
she's into the nightlife.[pcms]

*2011|
[fc]
Well, I think you can't really know a person just by looking at their[r]
surface anyway.[pcms]

If the rumors were true, I'd want her to hit on me...[pcms]

*2015|
[fc]
I accidentally grip the rice I'm polishing tightly.[pcms]

*2016|
[fc]
Even in the hustle and bustle near Shibuya Station, Ochi-san and[r]
senior Minami were giving off a sweet and pleasant scent.[pcms]

*2017|

The scent is involuntarily recreated in my mind.[pcms]

That scent is irresistible... it's making my cock hard...[pcms]
