The clock had already passed noon, and it was approaching the hottest[r]
time of the day.[pcms]

*1951|
[fc]
It wasn't the best condition for walking on a path with a steep[r]
gradient and no actual road.[pcms]

*1952|
[fc]
But there was no convenient path that led from the shrine to the[r]
center of the island.[pcms]

*1953|
[fc]
If we went down to the nearby town first and then moved east, there[r]
would be plenty of roads, but passing through densely populated areas[r]
was too dangerous for various reasons.[pcms]

*1954|
[fc]
In the end, we had to walk on this animal trail, but reasoning alone[r]
couldn't compensate for physical strength.[pcms]

*1955|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Have we finally finished going downhill?"[pcms]

[vo_aka s="akari0408"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"Yes..."[pcms]

*1957|
[fc]
Akari-san was using her naginata as a makeshift cane, barely managing[r]
to walk.[pcms]

*1958|
[fc]
It looked more like her movements were stiff rather than her being[r]
unsteady on her feet.[pcms]

*1959|
[fc]
There was no doubt we were both suffering, but in Akari-san's case, it[r]
seemed to be on a different level than mine.[pcms]

*1960|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Let's take a little break."[pcms]

*1961|
[fc]
[vo_aka s="akari0409"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"No... I'm okay..."[pcms]

*1962|
[fc]
Akari-san's walking pace had noticeably slowed down. It couldn't just[r]
be fatigue causing this.[pcms]

*1963|
[fc]
Even though I have much less stamina than Akari-san, I'm still feeling[r]
energetic, which makes me think this exhaustion is abnormal.[pcms]

*1964|
[fc]
Without a doubt, it's not just fatigue but the effects of the virus at[r]
play here.[pcms]

*1965|
[fc]
Considering we have to go up an incline from here, it seemed[r]
impossible with her in this condition.[pcms]

*1966|
[fc]
I took out water, my phone, a bat, and a towel, and threw everything[r]
else into the forest.[pcms]

Then, after storing the water in Akari-san's bag, I draped the towel[r]
around my neck and crouched down.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Akari-san, from here on out I'll carry you on my back. It'll be much[r]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1973|
[fc]
It seemed Akari-san realized that being reserved here wouldn't help[r]
the situation progress.[pcms]

*1974|
[fc]
I held the bat in my hand behind my back and helped Akari-san onto it[r]
so that her butt was resting on it as I stood up.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"It's okay, Akari-san is light."[pcms]

*1978|
[fc]
For someone with little stamina like me, supporting the weight of two[r]
people was quite tough.[pcms]

*1979|
[fc]
But if I let Akari-san walk, it seemed like we would waste an[r]
irrecoverable amount of time.[pcms]

Honestly, I had absolutely no spare energy left.[pcms]

If I stopped walking now, I felt like I wouldn't be able to move[r]

But I had to carefully consider my pace. When the time came to rest, I[r]

[vo_aka s="akari0416"]

Once you become conscious of your hunger, your mind starts to fill[r]

It's a good distraction from the fatigue, though.[pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"When we get to Misao-san's place, let's feast again. Grilled sea[r]

I had the impression you were more into vegetables and fruits. Maybe[r]
I've been fooled by a girl's image?[pcms]

Considering how much you exercise, you must be eating things that[r]
build stamina.[pcms]
