"Sorry, but it's a bit hard for me to move... Can you take the[r]
intercom off Oz and bring it here?"[pcms]

"Understood..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

I knelt down near Oz's body. Blood was flowing from his head. His eyes[r]
were rolled back, and he was dead.[pcms]

*2878|
[fc]
It's a bit creepy. I'd rather not touch it if I could help it. But[r]
since Souichirou-san went out of his way to ask, it must be[r]
necessary...[pcms]

*2879|
[fc]
I wondered what I would do if he suddenly came back to life and[r]
attacked me. With that thought in mind, I hesitantly reached out my[r]
hand.[pcms]

*2880|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Ugh..."[pcms]

*2881|
[fc]
I removed the intercom and picked it up with my fingertips. Then I[r]
placed it on the desk.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz03"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"It's okay, the intercom won't bite you."[pcms]

*2883|
[fc]
With a laugh, Souichirou-san checked the intercom.[pcms]

"Yeah... just as I thought, it's turned off. Now, here's the plan.[r]
I'll use this to call the guys downstairs over here."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz04"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"They'll come up using the VIP elevator that goes directly from the[r]
lobby. You guys should... let's see... hide in the bathroom and wait[r]
it out, then head down to the lobby when they've passed."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Find your sister, rescue her, and then escape from the hotel."[pcms]

"...Don't say it like it's easy. There's no way out."[pcms]

"Why not? How did you get here? Just retrace your steps."[pcms]

"Uh... that is... We came here by shuttle bus. We were planning to[r]
park next to the emergency stairs..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st32"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_stk s="satuki_nt0173"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"But due to my driving mistake, we crashed right into the emergency[r]
stairs. I don't think that bus will move again. So there's no way to[r]
escape from the hotel, even if we find my sister."[pcms]

*2891|
[fc]
Senior Minami explained with a look of regret, slightly bowing her[r]
head. Souichirou-san nodded thoughtfully and then took a key out of[r]
the drawer and placed it on the desk.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2892|

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"Feel free to use this. It'll take you from the staff passage in the[r]
lobby to my car in the garage. If the lobby is safe, then that place[r]
should be safe too."[pcms]

*2893|
[fc]
[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"From there, you can escape by car."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="st2_se1_a"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_st01"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_stk s="satuki_nt0174"]
[ns]Satsuki[nse]
"But if we do that... what will you do?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz03"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"You're a kind young lady. Don't worry about me. In any case... my[r]
life won't last much longer."[pcms]

*2896|
[fc]
As he said this, Souichirou-san looked up at Akari standing beside[r]
him. Akari's face twisted in distress. Tears were welling up in her[r]
eyes.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ak2_sw4"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_ak07"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_aka s="akari_nt0149"]
[ns]Akari[nse]
"...The bleeding won't stop. I'm pressing down on it, but... the[r]
blood... my brother's blood..."[pcms]

*2898|
[fc]
Akari had been standing by Souichirou-san's side all this time.[pcms]

*2899|
[fc]
She was hidden in the shadow of Souichirou-san's body, but it seemed[r]
she had been continuously pressing down on the wound.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz2_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F2_kz02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=0 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2900|
[fc]
[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"Akari... that's enough. Let go of your hand... and go with everyone.[r]
Now, don't hesitate and take the key."[pcms]

*2901|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"...Understood. Thank you very much."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2902|
[fc]
I felt conflicted inside. The irony of being helped at the very end by[r]
the person who caused this tragedy...[pcms]

*2903|
[fc]
But rescuing my sister was the priority. I picked up the key from the[r]
desk.[pcms]
