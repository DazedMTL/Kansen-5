We could only exclaim in surprise at the colorful array of seafood[r]
dishes laid out before us.[pcms]

*5308|
[fc]
From seasonal sashimi to grilled dishes, fried foods, sushi, stews,[r]
and soups, there was an overwhelming array of food.[pcms]

Honestly, there were many things I had never eaten before, and I was[r]

I understand eel, but what's grouper? It must be a local fish, but I[r]
can't tell which one it is.[pcms]

Not sweating the small stuff, I reached out with my chopsticks for the[r]
pickled fried food.[pcms]

As Miss Misao began serving rice to us, Miss Ochi found the soup and[r]
started ladling it into bowls.[pcms]

Perhaps as a host, just eating isn't satisfying enough for her.[pcms]

"Thank you. Is this like fisherman's soup?"[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5334|
[fc]
Receiving a large bowl of soup with fish and vegetables stewed in it,[r]
I began to sip it.[pcms]

*5335|
[fc]
I could feel a wholesome comfort spreading throughout my body as if I[r]
was eating something very healthy.[pcms]

"It's rewarding to cook when there are boys around. Please enjoy your[r]

*5337|

The maid seemed to read the room and left with a pleasant smile.[pcms]

*5338|
[fc]
She had an unassuming islander vibe about her but seemed to be very[r]
considerate.[pcms]

We continued to eat our fill of rice while trying various unusual[r]
dishes.[pcms]

"Big Brother!"[pcms]

*5346|
[fc]
There, the uncle of Ochi-san we met at the hotel, a man named Kazuo,[r]
entered the room with a cheerful smile.[pcms]

*5347|
[fc]
We tensed up a bit and retracted our extended chopsticks to see what[r]
would happen.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz1_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_kz02"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=350 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5348|
[fc]
[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"Please don't hold back and continue eating, this can be for dessert[r]
later."[pcms]

*5349|
[fc]
Even though he was just returning to his nearby family home, bringing[r]
a souvenir showed his thoughtfulness.[pcms]

*5350|
[fc]
None of us had brought a gift. Students might worry about being too[r]
forward if they did something like that.[pcms]

*5351|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Um, thank you very much for inviting us today."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz1_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_kz03"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=350 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5352|
[fc]
[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"If you're friends of Akane-ri, you're always welcome."[pcms]

*5353|
[fc]
When we all bowed at once, Mr. Kazuo returned the gesture with a[r]
smile.[pcms]

*5354|
[fc]
It was a natural and gentle smile that was completely unreadable.[pcms]

*5355|
[fc]
Talking to this person, one could easily find themselves charmed by[r]
his personality.[pcms]

*5356|
[fc]
His communication skills must be extraordinary.[pcms]

"You're quite late, were you busy?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kz1_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=5 chface="F1_kz09"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=350 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"The traffic was unusually heavy. I even had trouble making way for an[r]
ambulance."[pcms]

*5359|
[fc]
It seemed that Misao-san was older or perhaps like an older sister to[r]
him.[pcms]

*5360|
[fc]
It was easy to see that Mr. Kazuo was showing respect to Misao-san.[pcms]

*5361|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"I heard from a local kid that it's tough around this time of year."[pcms]

*5362|
[fc]
[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"If we're going to invite the festival again next year, we'll need[r]
more cooperation not just from the municipality but also from the[r]
prefecture."[pcms]

*5363|
[fc]
While expressing his reflections, Mr. Kazuo took his seat at the table[r]
and lightly touched his chopsticks to the food as he said[r]
'itadakimasu'.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=3 chbase="mi1_si"][ChrSetParts layer=3 chface="F1_mi04"][ChrSetXY layer=3 x=60 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Misao[nse]
"Isn't this event exceeding the island's capacity? I understand what[r]
they want to do though."[pcms]

*5365|
[fc]
Misao-san seemed not to like Mr. Kazuo very much, as she spoke with a[r]
sharp tone that put him on the spot.[pcms]

*5366|
[fc]
Mr. Kazuo laughed and said something like 'I can't win against an[r]
older sister,' but it made me want to follow up for him.[pcms]

*5367|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Um, even the first Fuji Fest had its chaos, but by making[r]
improvements, the event became established. So I think there's meaning[r]
in accumulating experience."[pcms]

*5370|
[fc]
She was a sharp beauty, but her warm smile seemed to fade away.[pcms]

*5371|
[fc]
When it came to Mr. Kazuo, Misao-san became quite strict.[pcms]

*5372|
[fc]
Relationships between people don't always go smoothly, do they?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=4 chbase="kz1_sui"][ChrSetParts layer=4 chface="F1_kz02"][ChrSetXY layer=4 x=650 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kazuo[nse]
"Tourism grows by continuing and increasing repeat visitors, do you[r]
understand, sister?"[pcms]

*5374|
[fc]
[vo_mis s="misao0018"]
[ns]Misao[nse]
"Yes, yes."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5375|
[fc]
Behind Mr. Kazuo's back was a window through which you could see the[r]
garden, and there was a figure reflected in it.[pcms]

*5376|
[fc]
It was the man in a black jacket who had spoken with Mr. Kazuo on the[r]
first day of the training camp.[pcms]

*5377|
[fc]
Then, from a blind spot out of view, a man in black stepped forward.[pcms]

*5378|
[fc]
It turned out there were security personnel lurking here too. I wonder[r]
if everyone else has noticed.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5379|
[fc]
The two didn't seem to exchange any words or eye contact and[r]
disappeared back into the darkness.[pcms]

It might just be how siblings are, but it seemed like Akari-san was[r]
flustered about what to do.[pcms]

Despite saying it's impossible, she seems to be trying to talk[r]

The two adults seemed to sense this and stopped sniping at each other.[pcms]

It's obvious, but Ochi-san is not to blame. Of course, neither are[r]
Misao-san nor Satsuki-san.[pcms]

There's no evidence, and it should only be considered one of many[r]
rumors.[pcms]

Even if it's just a rumor, the victim is right next to us, so it's[r]

No, what am I thinking? What fault lies with Ochi-san?[pcms]

It's unimaginable how much the people of this house have suffered from[r]
being the subject of such rumors.[pcms]

The slander, the insidious media coverage, the reputational damage to[r]
