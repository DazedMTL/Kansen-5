"Let's eat."[pcms]

*2212|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Let's eat."[pcms]

*2213|
[fc]
Onee-san started eating in an incredibly light outfit, just a tank top[r]
and a thong.[pcms]

*2214|
[fc]
I'm used to it by now, so I don't bother pointing it out anymore.[pcms]

*2215|
[fc]
A cheap fan from a suspicious maker was slowly oscillating left and[r]
right, stirring up the lukewarm air.[pcms]

*2216|
[fc]
It wasn't one with six blades from a famous maker, but an old one with[r]
three blades.[pcms]

*2217|
[fc]
Onee-san believes that it's natural for summer to be hot, so she[r]
basically just uses the fan.[pcms]

*2218|
[fc]
That's why, after a bath, she eats in an outfit that's hardly[r]
different from her underwear.[pcms]

*2219|
[fc]
I have the air conditioning on low in my room, but she never complains[r]
about it.[pcms]

*2220|
[fc]
She just says it's her preference, and it doesn't seem to be based on[r]
any particular principle or belief.[pcms]

*2221|
[fc]
By the way, she was standing in the kitchen making side dishes in that[r]
outfit just a while ago, but I wasn't fazed.[pcms]

*2222|
[fc]
Wandering around in almost bare-ass condition without wearing a bra is[r]
truly not good for education.[pcms]

*2223|
[fc]
But I had released my desires earlier and reached the state of a sage,[r]
so I managed to get by with just glancing instead of staring.[pcms]

"I wonder if I'm sweating more than you?"[pcms]

*2227|
[fc]
In our house, we have a policy of not turning on the TV during meals.[pcms]

*2228|
[fc]
Since spring, we've been able to listen to live radio over the[r]
internet, so that's what we mainly do now.[pcms]

*2229|
[fc]
The reason Onee-san connected speakers to her laptop was that the[r]
built-in ones were terribly prone to sound distortion.[pcms]

*2230|
[fc]
Right now, a talk show is on, discussing the summer rock festivals.[pcms]

*2231|
[fc]
A female announcer, a personality, and the editor-in-chief of a music[r]
magazine are passionately talking about their appeal.[pcms]

*2232|
[fc]
Onee-san listens to Japanese rock quite a bit, so this program has[r]
become a regular staple for us.[pcms]

*2233|
[fc]
It's what you'd call a strip show, where they change the personality[r]
from Monday to Friday and offer broadcasts with various themes.[pcms]

*2234|
[fc]
I have a hard time with the Friday personality, but I've resigned[r]
myself to it as something that can't be helped.[pcms]

*2235|
[fc]
Not everything can go exactly as I want it to.[pcms]

"The miso soup is delicious. Have you improved your cooking skills?"[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Maybe it turned out well because I made it quickly and stopped the[r]
heat at the right time?"[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2238|
[fc]
By the way, there's a reason we don't turn on the TV at home.[pcms]

*2239|
[fc]
We used to watch a news program while eating dinner, and they did a[r]
special on the Tohoku Epidemic.[pcms]

*2240|
[fc]
But the content was too much... Onee-san got so furious that she[r]
destroyed the TV in an incident.[pcms]

*2241|
[fc]
The TV we managed to buy again exists for Onee-san to play games,[r]
watch movies, and enjoy sports.[pcms]

*2242|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*2243|
[fc]
Even so... the rice is delicious.[pcms]

*2244|
[fc]
Onee-san's cooking skills have reached a level that ordinary[r]
housewives can't even come close to matching.[pcms]

*2245|
[fc]
Pork saut and shredded cabbage, meat and potatoesit shows[r]
consideration for getting vitamins in summer.[pcms]

*2246|
[fc]
Tonight's meal is relatively simple because she was busy, yet it[r]
tastes this good.[pcms]

*2247|
[fc]
Usually, she makes more complicated dishes deliciously... but even the[r]
simple dishes are more than satisfying.[pcms]

*2248|
[fc]
In front of Ochi-san and Senior Minami, I tried to act cool, but the[r]
difference between Onee-san's and my cooking skills was clear.[pcms]

*2249|
[fc]
After working hard all day, I'm truly grateful to Onee-san for serving[r]
such delicious meals every day.[pcms]

*2250|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"!"[pcms]

*2251|
[fc]
"That's right, I completely forgot, but now might be a good time to[r]

Onee-san initially looked confused, but then she stared at me in[r]
surprise.[pcms]

She seems to be at a loss for words due to my insistence.[pcms]

came over to sit next to me.[pcms]

[fc]
Then, she hugged me tightly with both arms.[pcms]
