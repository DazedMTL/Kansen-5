She acts like an older sister... but I'm actually a year older than[r]

Ever since we got close during the spring tournament coverage, Ochi-[r]

Honestly, it's complicated being patted on the head by Ochi-san, but[r]
happiness wins out.[pcms]

Thinking about it, being short and not much different in height from[r]
Ochi-san or having a feminine face isn't so bad after all.[pcms]
