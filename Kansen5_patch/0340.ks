"Haa..."[pcms]

*4644|
[fc]
As a witness to the accident, I had to undergo police questioning,[r]
just like some of the teachers and students.[pcms]

*4645|
[fc]
It seems they wanted to let the students from the sports clubs go home[r]
early to rest, so mainly members of the newspaper and photography[r]
clubs were taken in for questioning.[pcms]

*4646|
[fc]
The male victim was a crew member of a ship docked at the island, and[r]
apparently, he had dined and dashed at a diner just before the[r]
accident.[pcms]

*4647|
[fc]
He must have taken advantage of the diner's busyness to even drink[r]
alcohol.[pcms]

*4648|
[fc]
Getting drunk, dining and dashing, and then getting hit by a car,[r]
creating a scene that's likely to become a traumatic memory is just[r]
inexcusable.[pcms]

*4649|
[fc]
Especially those red eyes.[pcms]

*4650|
[fc]
The image of red eyes seemingly drowning in a sea of blood was stuck[r]
in my mind and wouldn't leave.[pcms]

After finishing the police questioning with my teacher, I left the[r]
station to find my sister, who was supposed to be at the hotel,[r]
waiting with a worried look on her face.[pcms]

*4654|

As soon as she saw me, she ran over at a sprinting speed and lifted me[r]
up in a hug.[pcms]

My sister's massive breasts were pressed against my face, making it[r]
hard to breathe.[pcms]

[fc]
The police officer standing next to us let out a strange noise, which[r]
was somewhat embarrassing.[pcms]

*4660|
[fc]

"Ow, put me down, please, Onee-san!"[pcms]

"Of course, I ran here, what else?"[pcms]

*4669|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*4670|
[fc]
As expected of a former Self-Defense Force member.[pcms]

*4671|
[fc]
She's used to running 20 kilometers with full gear, so a marathon on[r]
flat ground is nothing for her.[pcms]

We couldn't exactly run back, so one of the police officers gave us a[r]
ride back in their patrol car.[pcms]

*4673|
[fc]
They seemed quite busy, and the patrol car that took us was from[r]
Ehime, having just arrived on the evening ferry.[pcms]

*4674|
[fc]
It seems there were multiple accidents on the island today, and it was[r]
right to call for backup.[pcms]

Ochi-san shrank a little in embarrassment and her cheeks turned red.[pcms]

Just as I was about to leave the room, my sister suddenly called out[r]

When I turned around, she had an indescribable look on her face and[r]
seemed troubled.[pcms]

Onee-san took out something that looked like a fan club newsletter and[r]

The purpose of this trip is to let Onee-san spread her wings. If it[r]

I wanted her to enjoy some delicious food though.[pcms]
