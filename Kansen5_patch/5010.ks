"Wow, that's a huge tree!"[pcms]

[ns]Shinji[nse]
"Yeah, it's big..."[pcms]

*114|
[fc]
I was looking up at the big tree with my father.[pcms]

*115|
[fc]
No matter how much I look up, it's so big that I can't see the whole[r]
thing.[pcms]

"Then, let's take a picture here!"[pcms]

My mother took out her camera and started looking around to see if[r]
anyone was nearby.[pcms]

[vo_mob s="taeko0002"]
[ns]Taeko[nse]
"Excuse me, could you please take a picture for us?"[pcms]

*119|
[fc]
As the woman smiled and took the camera, my mother noticed a little[r]
girl.[pcms]

*120|
[fc]
The little girl was hiding at the woman's feet, looking up at my[r]
mother.[pcms]

[vo_mob s="taeko0003"]
[ns]Taeko[nse]
"Oh, what a cute child! Hello there."[pcms]

*122|
[fc]
The woman encouraged the small child at her feet to greet us.[pcms]

*123|
[fc]
But the girl seemed too shy and just fidgeted without saying much.[pcms]

Perhaps reassured by my mother's kind smile, the girl raised her face[r]
to greet us.[pcms]

*126|
[fc]
She's so cute...[pcms]

*127|
[fc]
I was utterly captivated by the girl's cuteness.[pcms]

*128|
[fc]
She was like an angel, not a kitten or a puppy.[pcms]

*129|
[fc]
I was just spellbound by the girl who finally managed to greet us with[r]
her head down.[pcms]
