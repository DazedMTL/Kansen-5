On this hot summer night, the heat from the crowd seemed to make the[r]
venue's temperature rise even more.[pcms]

*47|
[fc]
Despite being outdoors, it's incredibly hot. Inside the venue, quite a[r]
few people are hanging towels around their necks.[pcms]

*48|
[fc]
I was at the peak of excitement, finally participating in the festival[r]
I'd been longing for. The heat didn't bother me at all. I really have[r]
to thank Makoto.[pcms]

*49|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0006"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Hyu-hyu--!"[pcms]

*50|
[fc]
The front was turning into a mosh pit. Naturally, I moved forward to[r]
join in.[pcms]

*51|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0007"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Sorry, excuse me-- let me through~"[pcms]

*52|
[fc]
My skin brushes against strangers, but in a place like this, you can't[r]
be concerned about such things.[pcms]

*53|
[fc]
Rather than that, I think pushing and shoving each other might[r]
actually help achieve a sense of unity with the artist.[pcms]

[ns]Male[nse]
"Ya--h!"[pcms]

*55|
[fc]
Someone jumps into me while body slamming. Others sway their bodies to[r]
the rhythm while brushing shoulders.[pcms]

*56|
[fc]
There are all sorts of people here. But there's no doubt that everyone[r]
is having fun.[pcms]

*57|
[fc]
I finally managed to get into the midst of it all.[pcms]

;<ImageShake2 0,15,0,10,0,10,OFF>

*58|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0008"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Yea--h!"[pcms]

*59|
[fc]
I jump and bump into the person next to me. The person next to me[r]
jumps back into me in return.[pcms]

*60|
[fc]
But--[pcms]

*61|
[fc]
[ns]Male[nse]
"Uhaa, wow, those tits"[pcms]

*62|
[fc]
[ns]Male 2[nse]
"Oh man, I'd love to be sandwiched by those~"[pcms]

*63|
[fc]
Somewhere, I could hear such voices.[pcms]

*64|
[fc]
I think it's inevitable, but I also think they should focus more on[r]
the performance.[pcms]

;<ImageShake2 0,15,0,10,0,10,OFF>

*65|
[fc]
But it's silly to engage with them, so I just keep swaying my body[r]
without caring.[pcms]

*66|
[fc]
My tits keep swaying impressively. I know they're drawing attention,[r]
but there's no point in worrying about that.[pcms]

;<ImageShake2 0,15,0,10,0,10,OFF>

*67|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0009"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Ya--h!"[pcms]

*68|
[fc]
I raise my fist, shake my body, jump and bump shoulders with the[r]
person next to me.[pcms]

*69|
[fc]
Someone said it's like a fierce competition for steamed buns.[pcms]

*70|
[fc]
This venue is still on the tame side.[pcms]

*71|
[fc]
Overseas, or depending on the artist, there are places where moshing[r]
is prohibited.[pcms]

*72|
[fc]
[ns]Male[nse]
"Whoa, what's with this guy!"[pcms]

*73|
[fc]
It seemed like there was a commotion happening a little distance away.[r]
I want to focus on the performance, but my attention is drawn there.[pcms]

*74|
[fc]
[ns]Male 2[nse]
"Is he crazy? Hey, let's carry him outside."[pcms]

*75|
[fc]
Suddenly, a man in the middle of the commotion is lifted up. Is he[r]
planning to crowd surf?[pcms]

*76|
[fc]
[ns]The Lifted Man[nse]
"Uhaa..."[pcms]

*77|
[fc]
The man lifted into the air is passed from hand to hand and carried[r]
towards the back.[pcms]

*78|
[fc]
It seems he'll be passing over me too. If that's the case, I've got to[r]
participate properly.[pcms]

*79|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0010"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Eh?!"[pcms]

*80|
[fc]
But as I reached out my hand, I froze for a moment at the sight of the[r]
man.[pcms]

*81|
[fc]
I couldn't tell where he was injured, but his face and clothes were[r]
covered in blood.[pcms]

*82|
[fc]
Seeing the man still smiling eerily despite that, I felt a chill run[r]
down my spine.[pcms]

*83|
[fc]
[ns]The Lifted Man[nse]
"Stop it-- put me down~"[pcms]

*84|
[fc]
As the man thrashed about in the air, his flailing limbs threw off the[r]
balance of those supporting him.[pcms]

*85|
[fc]
The many hands couldn't support him anymore, and the man came falling[r]
towards me.[pcms]

*86|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0011"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Whoa!"[pcms]

*87|
[fc]
Unable to catch him, I ended up being embraced by the man as we both[r]
fell to the ground.[pcms]

*88|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0012"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Ow ow ow ow..."[pcms]

*89|
[fc]
[ns]Male 3[nse]
"What the hell are you doing?! Think about the trouble you're[r]
causing!"[pcms]

*90|
[fc]
A guy nearby grabbed the man by the scruff of his neck and made him[r]
stand up. Several other men surrounded him and took him away towards[r]
the back.[pcms]

*91|
[fc]
[ns]Male 4[nse]
"Are you okay?"[pcms]

*92|
[fc]
Grasping the hand offered to me, I quickly got up.[pcms]

*93|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0013"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Yeah, thanks."[pcms]

*94|
[fc]
[ns]Male 4[nse]
"Whoa, wait, you're bleeding. Did you get hurt somewhere?"[pcms]

*95|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0014"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

*96|
[fc]
[ns]Male 4[nse]
"Your face, your face. Doesn't it hurt? Look, next to your lip. Did[r]
you cut it?"[pcms]

*97|
[fc]
I unconsciously rubbed the area around my lip with my hand. Indeed,[r]
there was a faint taste of iron in my mouth.[pcms]

*98|
[fc]
But I didn't feel any pain anywhere.[pcms]

*99|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0015"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"I seem to be fine. Sorry, and thank you."[pcms]

*100|
[fc]
[ns]Male 4[nse]
"It's okay, but man, what an annoying guy. If you're going to surf, at[r]
least let yourself be carried properly."[pcms]

*101|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0016"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Ah, right."[pcms]

*102|
[fc]
[ns]Male 4[nse]
"Well, let's shake it off and both have fun!"[pcms]

*103|
[fc]
[vo_nat s="natu_st0017"]
[ns]Natsu[nse]
"Yeah! Urya!"[pcms]

;<ImageShake2 0,15,0,10,0,10,OFF>

*104|
[fc]
I did a light jump and bumped into the guy who had shown concern for[r]
me. He laughed with a "kuhaha" and bumped back into me.[pcms]

;<ImageShake2 0,15,0,10,0,10,OFF>

*105|
[fc]
The festival is far from over. Forget what's passed and have fun![pcms]
