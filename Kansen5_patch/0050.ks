What should I do? Nishi and Hatakeyama are telling me to follow them,[r]
but the teacher is saying no...![pcms]

*860|
[fc]
Why did this happen? What should I do now?![pcms]

*861|
[fc]
I don't know which way to run. I don't know whose words to trust.[pcms]

*863|
[fc]
A crowd of people swarmed around the teacher.[pcms]

*864|
[fc]
Men, women... Grandfathers and grandmothers.[pcms]

*865|
[fc]
All sorts of people grabbed the teacher's body and pulled in whatever[r]
direction they wanted.[pcms]

*866|
[fc]
[ns]Teacher[nse]
"You guys! Don't go! Stop!!! Ahh! You fools!! Gyaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!"[pcms]

*867|
[fc]
I couldn't believe my eyes.[pcms]

*868|
[fc]
Our teacher was being attacked by a crowd of people, spurting red[r]
liquid from all over his body and convulsing![pcms]

*869|
[fc]
The faces dyed red were biting into the teacher's body everywhere,[r]
laughing as they did so.[pcms]

*870|
[fc]
One of them, with a face drenched in the teacher's blood, turned[r]
towards us.[pcms]

*871|
[fc]
In the center of the blood-soaked face, those red eyes shone brightly.[pcms]

*872|
[fc]
My eyes were fixed on that dark yet vivid red color.[pcms]

*873|
[fc]
[ns]Teacher[nse]
"Guh... Aaagiiii!!! No good... run... Nakazawa!! Don't stop! Run!!"[pcms]

*874|
[fc]
The teacher, in the midst of the writhing crowd, shouted the complete[r]
opposite of what he said before.[pcms]

*875|
[fc]
The teacher's voice gradually turned into a sound like a torn thread.[pcms]

*876|
[fc]
Immediately after, the teacher's head, soaring through the air, was[r]
reflected in my wide-open eyes.[pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001i"][trans_c cross time=300]

"Tea... Teacher!! Nishi! The teacher's been taken down by them! We[r]

[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Stop it, Makoto! You saw the number of them! There's no way we can[r]
win against that!! It's useless to go!!"[pcms]

*879|
[fc]
[ns]Nishino[nse]
"If we just stand here, we'll be eaten too! I don't want to be killed[r]
by those things!! Hurry! We have to run now!!"[pcms]

*880|
[fc]
The crowd kicked the teacher's head around like a soccer ball.[pcms]

*881|
[fc]
The crowd trampled over the headless teacher's torso.[pcms]

*882|
[fc]
The crowd was fighting over the teacher's body![pcms]

[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Ah... Ah... Aaaahhh!!! Teacher! Teacherrrr!!! Uwaaaahhhhhhh!!![r]
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"[pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001j"][trans_c cross time=300]

*884|
[fc]
I saw it. The teacher's head flying through the air.[pcms]

*885|
[fc]
I saw it. The teacher's mouth forming the shape of a scream telling us[r]
to run.[pcms]

*886|
[fc]
Yet my legs just trembled. What should I do...?[pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001i"][trans_c cross time=300]

Cloudy red eyes like those of a rotten fish appeared right in front of[r]
my face.[pcms]

*891|
[fc]
With a creepy smile and eyes that looked at me as if I were a feast,[r]
she stood there.[pcms]

*892|
[fc]
No... This is bad! I'll end up like the teacher![pcms]

*893|
[fc]
Having my neck cut off, my arms torn away... I'm going to die![pcms]

"*groan*..."[pcms]

*898|
[fc]
I mustered all the strength I had ever had in my life, kicked the[r]
strange girl in the stomach, and using the recoil, I dashed towards[r]
the two waiting for me.[pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001g"][trans_c cross time=300]

*899|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Wait for me! Wait... *pant*... *pant*..."[pcms]

*900|
[fc]
Nishi from the soccer club and the mischievous Hatakeyama. I couldn't[r]
catch up to them with my legs.[pcms]

*901|
[fc]
Even though my heart felt like it was about to burst out of my chest[r]
from beating so fast and hard. Even though I was running with a[r]
painfully tight side.[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=500][hide_chara_int]

*902|
[fc]
[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Over there, the door's open! We can escape in there!"[pcms]

*903|
[fc]
The place Hatakeyama pointed to while running didn't seem particularly[r]
ravaged.[pcms]

*904|
[fc]
It was as if it had been waiting for us, with the door wide open.[pcms]

*905|
[fc]
If we could make it there, we might be saved. We might be able to[r]
escape from those weird ones.[pcms]

*906|
[fc]
With hope in my heart, I clutched my aching side and kicked off the[r]
ground even harder than before.[pcms]

*907|
[fc]
Nishi and Hatakeyama must feel the same way. Yet, the distance between[r]
me and the two of them was growing.[pcms]

*908|
[fc]
If this continues, I might be left behind. Even if they say we're best[r]
friends, they saw the teacher get killed.[pcms]

*909|
[fc]
But I don't want to be abandoned. I want to live too! I absolutely[r]
don't want to die like that![pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001e"][trans_c cross time=300]

[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Hey, Makoto, hurry up!"[pcms]

*911|
[fc]
[ns]Nishino[nse]
"Makoto! Hang in there! Just a little more!!"[pcms]

*912|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Both of you... *sob*... Uwaaaahhh!!!"[pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001f"][trans_c cross time=300]

*913|
[fc]
Even though they want to be saved themselves, they are waiting for me![pcms]

*914|
[fc]
They really are my best friends![pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001g"][trans_c cross time=300]

*915|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"*sob*... Thank you... Hatakeyama! Nishi!!"[pcms]

[evcg storage="etc_N001h"][trans_c cross time=300]

*916|
[fc]
In contrast to them... I feel ashamed for doubting them...[pcms]

*917|
[fc]
I ran with all the strength I could muster, answering to their[r]
friendship.[pcms]

*918|
[fc]
Just a few more meters. Just a little further and I'll reach the room[r]
where my best friends are waiting. If I'm with those two, we can[r]
survive this crazy situation.[pcms]

*919|
[fc]
I felt tears naturally overflowing from my eyes due to the friendship[r]
of the two and the sense of security it brought.[pcms]

*920|
[fc]
But just then--[pcms]

[evcg storage="mob_N005a"][trans_c cross time=300]

*921|
[fc]
[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Oi! Nishi!! Behind... behind!!"[pcms]

*922|
[fc]
The strange ones had started gathering in the room I was aiming for.[pcms]

*923|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man[nse]
"Abbaaaahhh... Agahh! Kuh... let me eat youuuu...!"[pcms]

*924|
[fc]
It's my fault... Because of my slow legs, I've put them both in[r]
danger![pcms]

*925|
[fc]
Dammit! Wait for me, Hatakeyama, Nishi! I'm your best friend too![pcms]

*926|
[fc]
I will save you guys![pcms]

*931|
[fc]
[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Uoooooh! I'm doing it too! Let's go, Nishi!!"[pcms]

*932|

The two exchanged glances and nodded at each other, then while staring[r]
down the staggering man approaching them, they simultaneously[r]
unleashed kicks and punches.[pcms]

"Abbaaah..."[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=500][hide_chara_int]

*934|
[fc]
Nishi is from the soccer club. Hatakeyama is a bit of a brawler and[r]
proud of his strength.[pcms]

*935|
[fc]
Both of them almost at the same time delivered their best attacks they[r]
were skilled at.[pcms]

*936|
[fc]
No one could possibly stay standing after taking such a direct hit.[pcms]

*937|
[fc]
[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Hey, Makoto! We're okay here now! Hurry up!!"[pcms]

*938|
[fc]
[ns]Nishino[nse]
"We're no good without the three of us! Without you, we can't[r]
function! So, we're all going to escape from here together! Makoto!"[pcms]

*939|
[fc]
Tears were overflowing in their eyes as well. It might have been to[r]
endure the fear.[pcms]

*940|
[fc]
But even in their tears, I felt a strange sense of solidarity.[pcms]

*941|
[fc]
Because the two of them told me I was their best friend. Because they[r]
said it wouldn't work unless the three of us were together.[pcms]

*942|
[fc]
Their words encouraged me. Thanks to them, I was able to leap into the[r]
room where the two of them were waiting for me.[pcms]

*943|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Ah... thank you... Nishi! Hatakeyama! Waaaah! Thank you...[r]
*sniffle*..."[pcms]

*944|
[fc]
Because of their friendship and relief, I couldn't hold back my[r]
emotions any longer, and the tears and voice that had been dammed up[r]
burst forth all at once.[pcms]

*945|
[fc]
[ns]Nishino[nse]
"Ahaha, what an awful face! Wipe your tears, Makoto! Ahaha!"[pcms]

*946|
[fc]
[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Don't cry, man, you're too old for that! Pfft...hahaha! Ahaha! Seeing[r]
your face somehow makes me feel relieved!"[pcms]

*947|
[fc]
[ns]Makoto[nse]
"Even if you say that... I'm just so happy... *sob*... Ah... Aaah!![r]
Nishi! Look out, it's that guy again!"[pcms]

*948|
[fc]
[ns]Nishino[nse]
"Eh... Ah..."[pcms]

[ns]Hatakeyama[nse]
"Ni... Nishi! Eh... Uh, uwaahhh!! When did they get like this!!"[pcms]

*950|

Our laughter of relief was cut short right there.[pcms]

It was a mistake to let our guard down. Before we knew it, we were[r]
surrounded by those weird guys.[pcms]
